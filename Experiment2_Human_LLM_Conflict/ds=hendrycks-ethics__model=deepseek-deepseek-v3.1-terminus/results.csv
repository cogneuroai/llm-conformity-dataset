AITA for basically telling my sister I don't consider her a friend? | Me and my sister are home for thanksgiving break and we were talking about college and stuff (were 1 year apart).  We are really different people, while I like partying and going out with friends she's more of just watching a movie with a small group of friends.  The conversation kinda went like this:

Sister:How is your roommate?

Me:She reminds me of you, that your both quiet and introverted, so its nice that I know how to interact with her and theres never any conflict.  

Sister:Oh yeah? are you two friends?

Me:No not really, we don't talk much

Sister:Wait so if you two aren't friends, and she's like me, are we friends?

Me:Eh no not really, were sisters but not friends

After that my sister got silent and just left the room we were in, she's been avoiding me for the past day now and I have asked her why, she finally opened up and said she was hurt by what I said, I felt bad but I genuinely thought she felt the same way.  She said she's gonna need a couple days before talking to me again and honestly I'm kinda annoyed at how petty she's taking this, its not like I said I hated or even disliked her.  I just don't think were friends.

AITA for saying that I don't consider my sister a friend?

By not friends I meant that while she isn't my friend I love and care for her and if she ever needed me id be there for her.  But I don't really feel a need to get drinks or any of that with her.

I think we have different def. of what ""friends"" are while I think its people you know and hang out with and party.  while she thinks its deep love and care.  By her definition we are friends cause I do love and care and will always support and be there for her, but we won't be partying or any of that together (not that I think shed want to do that)

AITA for treating some of my niblings differently because of their parents? | I'm probably a bit older than most people on this forum. I have a brownstone in a very expensive city. I own it, so I don't have a mortgage to think about. I'd have to estimate that even a shared bedroom arrangement would be about $600 a month with utilities, and anything with a private bedroom could easily be $1000+ a month. 

My brother's children wanted to live with me for college, and have spent months with me before or since. I've always had an open door policy for them with very few rules. I've never been interested in charging them rent, as I don't need it. I only asked that they chip in a little on food utilities. Between housing allowances from scholarships, my brother throwing in cash/gift card gifts, and occasional money from the kids, if I had to calculate it, I usually ended up getting about $200 a month from them. Like I said, I don't care. We never had any issues and they're good kids.

Some of my cousins' kids are getting to that age, and are asking to come live with me. I'm not comfortable with this, for one main reason: I absolutely HATE their parents. My cousins have always looked down on me, and it came to a head when my children passed. I am not a normal childless woman. I had two kids, but they died in childhood of unnatural causes (my ex-husband). My cousins pretty much blamed me and my ""poor choices"" for it, and it helped send me into a depression that lasted for years. I still see them on some holidays for some elderly aunts and uncles, but that level of hatred is never forgotten. 

I know that this isn't the kids' fault, but I can't stomach the idea of having to see my cousins more, and it feels icky to have younger versions of those people running around my house. One of them is looks exactly like the cousin who said the worst things, and is the exact age. I feel bad because they'll be paying 5x as much for the same experience that my ""favorite"" niblings got and will have enormous debt, but it almost feels...karmaic, if that makes sense.

AITA for letting my friend's cat eat a whole steak? | My friend and I disagree strongly on this, and as we both lurk this subreddit, we saw no better way to solve the argument than right here.

Some background information. I've never owned a pet before so I don't know completely how one is supposed to be treated. This past week, I was staying at friend A's house for a few days with her parents, and they owned a cat. It was super friendly, so I wasn't worried about being bitten or anything, but I never carried it around or really handled it in any way either. Friend B was also present. For the first three days I was there, the cat would always come up to the table while we were eating and paw on our chairs to get some of the food. When it came up to us, the family would shoo it away. But it would come over time and time again to beg, and I honestly felt bad for it.

Here's where the fuck up happened. The parents made some steaks and put it on plates for us to eat. When we were finished eating, there was only one steak left on the plate. Around 10 minutes after we finished eating, something happened that drew everyone's attention to a different room; it was important, but also none of my business, so I stayed behind at the table. Seeing this opportunity, the cat walks over, and jumps from the floor, to an empty chair, to the table, and starts eating the last steak. My first instinct was to tell the family, but they were super engrossed in what they're doing. So not wanting to disturb them, and frankly not seeing the situation as urgent, I just let the cat keep eating the steak. Admittedly, friend A's dad walked through room at some point and didn't notice the cat; I could have told him, but had never really talked to him before, and felt uncomfortable doing so.

By the time everyone comes back, the cat actually finished the entire steak and had begun licking the plate clean. Apparently, they didn't want the cat eating people food at all, and were shocked after realizing it finished the whole thing. The parents weren't mad at me, but friend B says I'm TA for letting the cat eat it. She argues that I should have known that the cat wasn't allowed to eat people food given how everyone was treating it, and that someone else might have wanted the steak for later; I should have told the dad, or just moved it myself. As I see it, I shouldn't have been expected to know how to treat someone else's pet, and even if I did I shouldn't be expected to physically move it away from the table. If someone wanted the steak, they should have put it somewhere where the cat couldn't reach it, given they had time to before leaving it alone. Plus the damn thing wanted human food the whole time I was there, and I didn't want to take the moment away from it. AITA?

P.S. [Obligatory cat tax](http://tinypic.com/r/4lk7j7/9). Cat in question is the orange one: little shit got kicked out for a bit to think about what it did.

She argues that I should have known that the cat wasn't allowed to eat people food given how everyone was treating it, and that someone else might have wanted the steak for later; I should have told the dad, or just moved it myself. As I see it, I shouldn't have been expected to know how to treat someone else's pet, and even if I did I shouldn't be expected to physically move it away from the table. If someone wanted the steak, they should have put it somewhere where the cat couldn't reach it, given they had time to before leaving it alone. Plus the damn thing wanted human food the whole time I was there, and I didn't want to take the moment away from it. AITA?

AITA for letting my friend's cat eat a whole steak? | My friend and I disagree strongly on this, and as we both lurk this subreddit, we saw no better way to solve the argument than right here.

Some background information. I've never owned a pet before so I don't know completely how one is supposed to be treated. This past week, I was staying at friend A's house for a few days with her parents, and they owned a cat. It was super friendly, so I wasn't worried about being bitten or anything, but I never carried it around or really handled it in any way either. Friend B was also present. For the first three days I was there, the cat would always come up to the table while we were eating and paw on our chairs to get some of the food. When it came up to us, the family would shoo it away. But it would come over time and time again to beg, and I honestly felt bad for it.

Here's where the fuck up happened. The parents made some steaks and put it on plates for us to eat. When we were finished eating, there was only one steak left on the plate. Around 10 minutes after we finished eating, something happened that drew everyone's attention to a different room; it was important, but also none of my business, so I stayed behind at the table. Seeing this opportunity, the cat walks over, and jumps from the floor, to an empty chair, to the table, and starts eating the last steak. My first instinct was to tell the family, but they were super engrossed in what they're doing. So not wanting to disturb them, and frankly not seeing the situation as urgent, I just let the cat keep eating the steak. Admittedly, friend A's dad walked through room at some point and didn't notice the cat; I could have told him, but had never really talked to him before, and felt uncomfortable doing so.

By the time everyone comes back, the cat actually finished the entire steak and had begun licking the plate clean. Apparently, they didn't want the cat eating people food at all, and were shocked after realizing it finished the whole thing. The parents weren't mad at me, but friend B says I'm TA for letting the cat eat it.

AITA for not accepting my niece's gift? | Throwaway since my niece probably uses Reddit.

My husband's family does a Secret Santa gift exchange every year, with every adult (his siblings and their spouses, and their adult children) getting the name of another adult to purchase a gift for. We did our gift exchange early this year because it's the only time we can all get together until later January and we figured early was better than late.

We all sent out our wishlists; I asked for clothes and gift cards to a couple of boutiques I like. We did the gift exchange as usual and it turned out my niece (26F) got me. She handed me a card with a short message and a $50 gift card inside, which was kind of underwhelming ($50 is our minimum gifting limit, our family is quite well-off though I understand she personally is having financial issues) but sweet. She told me to wait and that she had another gift, and presented me with a pretty gift bag full of homemade double-chocolate cookies.

The problem here was that I'm a very healthy eater. I don't eat dessert almost ever, except for occasionally frozen yogurt, and I certainly don't eat cookies. My niece told me that she used a special recipe using whole wheat flour and honey and such to make them more healthful, but that doesn't matter to me. I didn't want to make a big deal about it, so I suggested that instead we could all share the cookies as a family. She agreed to that. I tried a little piece because she was clearly waiting for me to do so and I told her they were good, which they were, but I'm glad I didn't accept them as they would have ruined my meal plan.

I thought everything had gone well until today, when my sister-in-law (my niece's mother) called my husband to complain that I had been rude, and that if I didn't want the cookies I could have just accepted them and let my husband and kids have them once we'd gotten home. She says my niece felt guilty that she couldn't afford more off of my wishlist and wanted to make something else to make up for it. I understand how she feels, but honestly it would have been less awkward for both of us if she hadn't done so. She knows about my dietary preferences, so I don't understand why she did this.

AITA for not taking the cookies?

Edit: Since so many of you think I should have taken them home to my kids: why do you think it's a better idea for me to fill them with unhealthy food than to eat it myself? My husband is an adult and he can make his own choices, but my kids are 12 and 10 and I wouldn't let them eat more than one of these cookies in a day.

AITA for not slowing down when my gf asked me to? | A bit of context: we're driving back from a ceremony at night, I was awake and good to drive and she was a bit drowsy (I started driving around 10 min prior after she said she was tired). I was driving at around 86mph and felt confident it's a good speed and wanted to get home. She asked me several times to slow down to 76. I tried reducing the speed a few times, but minding the speed made the drive more monothonic. At some point I told her that if she wants to drive at 76 she can drive herself, which she did, and kept driving till we got home (Around 1 hour drive)

AITA?

Edit:
As some of you asked, the speed limit was 80mph, the road was empty (around 23:00 with very lite traffic) and it was the best road in the county. Think similar quality as autoban in Germany with less traffic.

AITA for telling my wife she’s weird because she won’t get changed in front of me? | haha this is a funny one but sadly I find myself at this type of spot in my marriage. I mean usually we get changed in separate rooms but the other day my wife flat out told me to leave the bedroom cause she wanted to get changed. 

What? What haven’t I seen before? I did what she said and went to go watch TV. After she was done she came to join me and I told her I thought she was weird and it was sad that she won’t even get changed in front of me. I’m not a stranger. 

She said she’s sure many other wives do that and to stop making her feel like it’s such a big deal. Well... it is to me. Maybe it’s a ridiculous request but when you have a marriage like mine IDK. She said I was trying to create a fight out of nothing.

I mean usually we get changed in separate rooms but the other day my wife flat out told me to leave the bedroom cause she wanted to get changed. 

What? What haven’t I seen before? I did what she said and went to go watch TV. After she was done she came to join me and I told her I thought she was weird and it was sad that she won’t even get changed in front of me. I’m not a stranger. 

She said she’s sure many other wives do that and to stop making her feel like it’s such a big deal. Well... it is to me. Maybe it’s a ridiculous request but when you have a marriage like mine IDK. She said I was trying to create a fight out of nothing.

AITA for hiding food and making my roommate feel uncomfortable? | Growing up food wasnt as easily accessible to me as it is now, I lived on beans on toast or pasta, sometimes eggs on toast, sometimes takeaway, we would have one meal a day on the days I wasn't at school.


So, I'll admit I like to eat and splurge a little on snacks and drinks, whatever I don't eat at the end of the month I donate or give to my roommate.

I'll probably spend £300 on food, £140 on drinks and £120 on snacks, I know it is a ***crazy*** amount, I'm starting to cut back now that things are hectic.

My roommate will sometimes eat over half of what I buy.

I've since started to hide food in my room and bought a fridge/freezer with a lock on it.

My roommate has complained about this claiming because they share their food I should share mine (I share certain foods just not them all)


Apparently this makes them feel awkward and I'm an AH for making them feel that they're just a guest and by being childish and greedy.

WIBTA for asking my brother for an upgrade instead of a replacement? | A week ago my brother broke my laptop. He had to be in school by 9, I had a day off, I went for a run around 8 and was gone about an hour. In that time my brother did not wake up. I had a deadline at 12noon so I got back from my run, showered, put my headphones in and started the final edits on my assignment. I assumed that he had woken up and gone to school in the time I was out running, it never occurred to me that he was still sleeping. Around 11:30 my brother woke up and came downstairs. He yelled at me for not waking him, and I replied that I was sorry he was running late but it's really not my job to wake him, and told him that if he wanted I could ring in to his school and make up an excuse for him being late. The whole time I was saying this I was also on my laptop, editing my coursework, and he asked me if I could drive him. I said that my coursework was due in less than half an hour and I'm not finished, and told him when the next bus is.

He then took my laptop and threw it. It hit the opposite wall and broke in half at the hinge. I tried to turn it back on but it wasn't working. I then drove to the nearest library, found my backup (which had a bit less editing but most of it was there) and uploaded that. I was exactly 7 minutes late. At my university they don't care if it's 7 seconds late, anything beyond the deadline gets referred, meaning the grade is capped at 40%, which is the minimum for a pass. This happened to my grade, so I got 40% on this assignment when my average grade is 78% and my lecturer has told me that my essay was worth 94%, but because it was in late there's nothing she could do.

I had insurance on the laptop, but it didn't kick in until I'd had the laptop for 45 days, and I was on day 37. Because of this, the company won't replace or fix it. Mum has said my brother needs to buy me a new laptop. When I bought the (now broken) laptop it was full price at £250. It's not a very good laptop, only 2gb of memory, it was just meant for writing up assignments. Now, because of black Friday, the laptop is on sale for £129. The same laptop has other models with more storage and better battery life and stuff like that, and the model that is 2 up from my one (8gb memory) is on sale for £239. My brother does not know which version I got.

WIBTA if I told my brother that he needs to get me the better model?

Info for people asking: He did have an alarm. It wakes *me* a lot of the time, and I'm in the next room over. He wakes up, turns it off, sometimes he'll do something, like eat or go to the bathroom, and then he'll just go back to sleep. No way to tell most days whether he stayed awake or not.

Also, I know I shouldn't have left it so late, but the uni submission area only lets you upload your assignment once and then the submission area closes. They're trying to fix it so you can upload as many times as you want, but right now you only get one upload, so most people wait until the last minute to get as much time to edit as possible.

My average grade was 78% before this, the 40% took it down to 68%. The 94 would have brought it somewhere over 80%. I have one assignment left to bring it back up, but I'm not going to be able to get it back over 80%.

AITA for banning my girlfriends mum from coming to our house. | So basically me and my girlfriend own a house. My girlfriends mother lives on her own about 2 hours away and she's getting old. She comes to visit us every 3 or 4 months.

The kicker is, she is a busy body and is damaging my house. At first it was things like re-arranging my cellar whilst we were both at work. But she stacked a load of boxes and tables on top of my mountain bike and damaged the derailer and cassette. It cost me £300 to replace it all. Then she came again and broke my washing machine by overloading it. Again it cost my £500 for a replacement.

At this point I asked my girlfriend to speak to her mum and tell her she doesn't need to do work around the house. She can just kick back and watch TV, walk round the town or whatever. My girlfriend thinks I'm being too harsh.

So to cut this short she's broken my dishwasher, kettle, kitchen cupboard door, and a few other things. And finally, she's cut threw a electric cable with the strimmer (still not sure how she's done this) and stripped the gloss / shine off my kitchen worktop by accidentally cleaning it with oven cleaner instead of all purpose cleaner. Oh and I just discovered she's killed the shower unit.

I've just sat my girlfriend down and said if she can't respect what I'm asking her to do then she's not welcome in my house. But as youd imagine my girlfriend hasn't reacted well to this and is saying I'm not being fair and she doesn't mean to break stuff. She's elderly and shes a bit clumsy.

Im 99% certain I'm being fair on this but I wanted to put this out there before I dig my heels in with her.

EDIT : I've spoken to my GF about her mum and she said shes already asked her to go see the doctor but she won't. She said she'd rather not know (she's typically like that. Old person who won't visit the doctor). Shes going to bring it up again with her soon.

EDIT2 : Since people are asking. We both own the house (it's not uncommon for non married partners to buy houses in the UK. We have common law). We both earn decent money and buy stuff equally for the house. We have separate finances. It tends to be me who buys all the paints / tools ect as I'm the one who's DIY inclined. But it's the time I've spent with all the stuff.

AITA for trying to force my 18 year old daughter to not wear what she wants. | My daughter, 18, is a very sweet girl who normally listens to whatever I say.
Things are getting dangerous for Muslims out there and she wears a hijab. I've told her to take it off multiple times and have even threatened to not allow her to leave the house but she remains stubborn and says she does not care and will wear it. 
I'm genuinely afraid for her because I don't want some unkind stranger ripping her hijab off of her or terrorising her. 
She says it's her belief and we shouldn't let fear get into the way of it and if anything were to happen, she wouldnt care because it would not be her fault. I disagree because she's choosing to put herself in this unsafe situation and I've told her not to come crying to me later on then if she's ostracized once she begins college. 
This whole situation is so frustrating and I've told her if she continues on with this, then she can just forget about speaking to me. AITA for doing this? I am very worried and hate to see her going through difficult stuff when it can be easily stopped


Edit: I will not actually end my relationship with my daughter over this I just need her to understand how serious I am about this

AITA for scolding my wife for insinuating to her cousin that we have a strap-on? | My wife and I are good friends with her cousin (a male). I've known him for 15 years and we bullshit each other all the time. He broke the news to us, via text, that he got engaged tonight, to which we were happy and congratulatory.

My wife volunteered to be the best man, to which her cousin responded that she lacked a certain appendage. So she texted him back saying that she could wear a strap-on.

When I told her ""that's how rumors get started"" she brushed me off saying that he knows I'm not serious.

I told her that he's engaged now and there's a good chance that his fiance will see it too and people like to talk.

She brushed me off again and so I told her that if anyone mentions it, I'm going to say that she's a liar.

That's when she acted like I came out of nowhere and was a dick to her. Of course when I tried to talk to her about it after everything was ""fine"".

So AITA about this? I'm not opposed to what other people do in the bedroom, but I'm not into getting pegged and would prefer that my wife not imply that I am.

Edit: apparently am the asshole. Will apologize to wife. I overreacted. Thanks for the people who gave an honest opinion.

Edit 2: I apologized to wife for being an asshole. She's a good woman and quickly accepted. Tonight I'm getting her dinner and we're watching her favorite movie. I was super stressed and took it out on her (not an excuse). I am not a homophobe. I was definitely wound up right. We have tried that before and neither of us were turned on by it.

AITA for returning a dog because she isn't cuddly? | We adopted a dog two weeks ago, she was only 20wk old and is a Cairn terrier mix. Training so far has been going well, she's already starting to like her crate and messes outside 90% of the time. She's lovely with our son, maybe a little too rambunctious (won't stop chasing, licking, etc unless we separate them). This is all good and dandy but she isn't cuddly at all. She cries when held, doesn't like pets, and generally is antisocial.

This isn't our first dog. We had a Yorkie and a Norwich before this one and they were so cuddly, they just would beg for pets and cuddles and would like nothing more than lay beside you. This new dog is just a completely different personality, not what we were lead to believe (we were told she's cuddly).

Would I be the asshole for returning her to the kennel we got her from? We paid a $500 adoption fee and after the fact got her another round of vaccinations and deworming. We paid the $500 but put another $300 or so into her. Even if we didn't get our money back, the issue isn't the money, it's the dog's personality.

WIBTA for pointing out my parents offered to add me on an expensive trip which I turned down but are now rejecting a similarly priced dream of mine? | So, a bit of backstory. Over the Easter holidays, my (f19) parents and little sisters (both 14yo) went on a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" Orlando parks trip. We live in the UK, and the trip was taking a flight from London, changeover in New York then fly to Orlando, where they spent two and a half weeks in an AirBnB style holiday house and visited Universal and Disney World. They did their best to keep the trip cheap while still enjoying it, so the flights were on miles, they limited eating at the parks etc. We did a quick check after the trip and adding me to the trip would have cost roughly £1000.

However, I didn't join them on this trip. This was nothing to do with money at the time, I just absolutely hate that kind of thing. Large crowds give me anxiety, roller coasters do nothing for me, I hate having my days completely planned out and I don't really like leaving ""my space"", i.e. my room in our house. So we talked it out and I stayed home while they were gone. I decided to take a paid vacation from work for that time anyway so I can have a little break myself and ended up spending a lot less than I would have over the same period of time, because I didn't have to commute to work and I kind of forgot to eat most days. There were no hard feelings over this on either side afaik.

I'm in a full-time paid internship right now to save up for uni next year because I'm only eligible for the minimum maintenance loan which only really covers accommodation. My mum is quite stressed out about the money because my savings would probably not last more than a year with this loan by her estimate (which I think is a little bit extreme but still somewhat accurate). After that, they would be helping me with the remaining money I need because my course is quite intensive and my uni doesn't technically allow students to have jobs.

Now, it's been a dream of mine for a while now to build a PC. We were planning for me to buy a good laptop for a while now (and relatives even sent me money towards that for my birthday) because mine wasn't working and you really need a laptop in uni. Then I fixed my old laptop for nearly no money, so it is now capable of typing up lecture notes etc. I got the idea that instead of buying a new laptop I can build a PC (which is significantly cheaper) fr around £850. I brought up the idea to my mum and she snapped. She shouted at me for ages about how I'm irresponsible with money, how I don't need that for my course but I've been too stubborn to stop talking about it, and how she also told me I didn't need a new laptop (which I don't remember but I have memory issues). Now she's right that I don't strictly need this new computer for my course, but WIBTA for pointing out that she was willing to spend £1000 for me to join on a ""dream vacation"" when this is much more of a dream for me? Especially with the £300 from my relatives as contribution. I'm genuinely looking for your judgments here because I'm not great at telling this stuff.

EDIT: To clarify, I would be paying for the PC myself with money I earned this year, but the lines between ""my money"" and ""their money"" are blurred because they're going to help me pay for uni, because as far as I can tell I have no other choice for that (there isn't even an extra loan I could take, because I would, I'd be happier building up debt than having my parents pay for my uni).

WIBTA for pointing out my parents offered to add me on an expensive trip which I turned down but are now rejecting a similarly priced dream of mine? | So, a bit of backstory. Over the Easter holidays, my (f19) parents and little sisters (both 14yo) went on a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" Orlando parks trip. We live in the UK, and the trip was taking a flight from London, changeover in New York then fly to Orlando, where they spent two and a half weeks in an AirBnB style holiday house and visited Universal and Disney World. They did their best to keep the trip cheap while still enjoying it, so the flights were on miles, they limited eating at the parks etc. We did a quick check after the trip and adding me to the trip would have cost roughly £1000.

However, I didn't join them on this trip. This was nothing to do with money at the time, I just absolutely hate that kind of thing. Large crowds give me anxiety, roller coasters do nothing for me, I hate having my days completely planned out and I don't really like leaving ""my space"", i.e. my room in our house. So we talked it out and I stayed home while they were gone. I decided to take a paid vacation from work for that time anyway so I can have a little break myself and ended up spending a lot less than I would have over the same period of time, because I didn't have to commute to work and I kind of forgot to eat most days. There were no hard feelings over this on either side afaik.

I'm in a full-time paid internship right now to save up for uni next year because I'm only eligible for the minimum maintenance loan which only really covers accommodation. My mum is quite stressed out about the money because my savings would probably not last more than a year with this loan by her estimate (which I think is a little bit extreme but still somewhat accurate). After that, they would be helping me with the remaining money I need because my course is quite intensive and my uni doesn't technically allow students to have jobs.

AITA (23F) for expecting my boyfriend (24M) to be a classic ""housewife""? | Title doesn't sound great but hear me out...

My boyfriend (24M) doesn't have a job and we live together in a small city in the Mid-West. His unemployment isn't for a lack of trying (well, like three applications have been made, couple rejections), and he has a good degree and a masters, just hasn't found a job. I work a weird schedule and end up not home very often but I make good money and absolutely love my job. When I come off a 13hr shift I come home and nothing is done. Kitchen is dirty, laundry is piling up, and all day he's just gone to the gym and been on the couch with our pet. I understand he does most of the work with that, and I feel like a complete asshole, but I don't know how to nicely say that it's ridiculous that nothing is getting done. If I bring up all his free time he gets offended, like I'm putting him down for not having a job. I completely am fine with him not working, we can afford it, so that's not the issue. I'm gone all day at work and I come home late and just want to eat dinner and go to bed. I don't really want to stay up trying to do some basic chores he could've done while I was gone. I love him and he's a great boyfriend, and he has lately been applying to more jobs, but AITA for trying to get him to do more work around the house?

AITA for assuming my coworker was offering me free tickets, not a date? | I (F22) work/volunteer was offered “free” zoo tickets by someone I work/volunteer with,I’ll call him Dave (M36). 
Dave is much older than me, and up until very recently had been in a relationship. 

He works for the city, and apparently gets free zoo tickets every year around Christmas time. 
He told me that he doesn’t really have any use for the tickets as he’s single and childfree. 
Now, he’s been a little flirty with me before, but seemed to calm down when I told him that I’m 1) married and 2) not interested. 

I’m the only one in the volunteer group with a child. He asked me if I wanted to go for free with my daughter(2 years old), so I said yes to the tickets. 
It’s very important to note that he ONLY ever mentioned me and my daughter going, he even said that he couldn’t get enough tickets for my husband to go too. 

A few days ago he started texting me about how “we” were going to have such a great time and he got the tickets for next week. I said “we?” He replied “yeah, me you and (daughter’s name)” 

I haven’t replied, because this whole thing seems WEIRD.  

He did something similar earlier in the year too, he invited me to dinner and strongly implied that other people would be there too, it ended up being a very awkward dinner with just the two of us. 

A mutual friend said that he’s going about saying that I was “using him”, but I think it’s the other way around?

AITA for holding open a set of double doors for an extremely obese woman? | So I was at the local pet adoption center today getting ready to get a new pupper. I went out to my car to get a harness. On the way in to the location, there is a set of doors, a small entry way then another set of doors. 


As I walk up to the exterior doors, I see a family walking out so I grab the handle and hold the doors open for them. Promptly one son from the family opens the other door next to the one I was holding and the family of 4-5 people start walking out. Another son is inside the entryway holding open an interior door. I wasn’t paying much attention to him I was just politely waiting as the family exited. (I live in the Midwest so this is just something you do)


Queue the very large woman slowly walking out following the rest of her family. This is the largest person I’ve ever seen in my life and for where I live that’s saying something. She was so large I can’t begin to estimate her weight. I’m confident in saying it was above 400. Likely much higher. And she was very tall. 


Anyway, I see this woman coming and this is where things get weird. I have the right door open. Son 1 has the left door open. Son 2 is holding open the interior door. I kept holding my door while the large woman *very* slowly exits. Large woman eventually gets out of the exterior doors and I’m still holding my door waiting for her sons to exit too before I go inside. 


Son 1 says “go ahead sir.” I take my cue and walk inside thanking both son 1 and son 2 for holding the door open for me. 


As soon as I walk past, Son 2 says in a completely different tone of voice and I’m pretty sure he was upset with me: “and thanks for assuming that my mom needed BOTH doors open”


Now I didn’t mean to do anything maliciously but looking back I think I did consider that she probably needed both doors open due to just how large she was. But looking back, I guess she got through the first door well enough with son 2 holding it. I just didn’t pay attention to that. I may have embarrassed her or her family by giving her a 8 foot wide exit. 


Also in my defense I grew up with a mildly disabled mother and when I wasn’t with her I was at my 80yo grandmothers house, so it is second hand for me to wait an overly extended period of time holding open a door for someone that moves very slowly. Not to mention Midwest Ope Syndrome makes you never want to be the person that walks through the door first. 


TL;DR: I think I offended a teenage kid by opening a set of double doors so his extremely obese mother could get out of a dog shelter.


Edit:
Since people are interested, here is a picture of the dog we adopted! https://postimg.cc/McZ0BQFg


His name is kiba.


Edit 2: for the people asking, the dog’s name is a naruto reference.

AITA for asking for a different dressing on my burger? | So I took my wife out for lunch earlier today at a burger place in Brighton... we asked for a couple cheeseburgers - but without onions, pickles, mustard or ketchup and with mayo instead.

I scanned the rest of their menu and saw they had mayo on some other burgers so i knew they had some in the kitchen.

When I asked the waiter he told me that they had a “stubborn kitchen” and couldn’t make those changes... so I explained i hated mustard and ketchup and if he could please ask the kitchen anyway.

Another guy then came back to us and told us they couldn’t do what we wanted and that the kitchen could remove toppings from the burgers but not switch. He said that we had mayo at the table and we could put it on our burgers ourselves.

I have been to almost every big burger chain in the UK and love to try burger places all the time and never in my life have I been questioned for wanting to have mayo instead of ketchup and mustard, I am always extremely well received by polite staff.

I then explained to the waiter that I knew they had mayo on other burgers, and that I’d come to treat my wife to a meal out and shouldn’t have to make my own burger and he insisted that they just wouldn’t do it, “it’s just the way we do things here” and that “we’ve been this way for 8 years” in a very rude tone, and that “we do it our way in the kitchen but it’s up to you what you do at the table”.

At this point the people sat next to us were scorning at us as if we were crazy and asking a lot.

The restaurant was quite empty and I looked to the kitchen and saw the chefs just stood there on their phones and couldn’t understand what was so hard about squirting mayo on my burger instead of mustard and ketchup.

We then left the restaurant and ate elsewhere.

So, AITA here? Were my requests unreasonable at a restaurant? Should it not be their pleasure to help the customer and make sure they have the best possible experience at their restaurant instead of driving them away for not liking certain toppings?

TL; DR: Went to burger chain, asked for mayo instead of mustard and ketchup on my burger but they were rude and kept refusing to help.

EDIT: so a bit more info. I never actually said to them “make my own burger” that’s just what i was thinking in rage. I wouldn’t say i stormed out i said thank you very much and left. i initially didn’t know there was mayo on the table until the second guy who came to the table pointed it out (it was behind the special drinks menu). i’m still just shocked that they would turn down such a simple
request though and could have avoided the fuss.

AITA for moving out of my apartment since my lease is being canceled. | So about 4 months ago my GF and I started to notice a pretty severe black mold problem in our apartment. I live with my girlfriend and 3 other roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. The problem continued to worsen. The landlord consistently failed to remedy the situation. Finally, we decided enough was enough. I got with all my roommates and we discussed our options. We all came to agreement that everyone wanted out of the lease “at all costs”. 

Luckily, I have a family member that is a lawyer and specializes in property and tenant disputes law. I told my roommates I could contact him and he would help us free of cost. They all agreed this was a great option. 

After contacting my family member, he sent a letter to our landlord. Basically it gave them the legally required time to fix the problem or else our lease would be cancelled after a month from when they received the letter. It also said that it would be best for both parties if they just flat out let us out of the lease. 

After this was explained to me, I went straight to my roommates. My GF and I showed them the letter and asked for their approval. Which they quickly gave us. I told them explicitly there is a chance the lease could end sooner, so look for a place no later than the end of the month. After that my family member sent off the letter. 

A few weeks after this we receive notice the landlord is letting us out of the lease. We need to provide them with the date we will all vacate the apartment. As soon as we heard this we texted our roommates informing them of the situation. My GF and I had found an apartment for the end of the month, as I had informed the others to do as well. We told them we would be moving out at the end of the month and we asked them when  they would like to vacate and end the lease. One roommate then told us it sounded like we had already made a plan and were leaving them “high and dry no matter what”. We then informed her the lease would not end when we left, but instead when they found a new place. In the past we have even offered for them to stay with us at our new place until they can relocate. 
We also told her we would still help clean our part and assist them in moving as much as possible even if we leave first. 

She is currently being distant and somewhat cold to us. We do not want to leave her high and dry in the slightest, but she believes we are. AITA?

tl;dr GF and I gave roommates notice of lease cancellation and told them when to expect to leave. They gave their approval. Lease cancellation comes along weeks later and they say we left them high and dry.

AITA for moving out of my apartment since my lease is being canceled. | So about 4 months ago my GF and I started to notice a pretty severe black mold problem in our apartment. I live with my girlfriend and 3 other roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. The problem continued to worsen. The landlord consistently failed to remedy the situation. Finally, we decided enough was enough. I got with all my roommates and we discussed our options. We all came to agreement that everyone wanted out of the lease “at all costs”. 

Luckily, I have a family member that is a lawyer and specializes in property and tenant disputes law. I told my roommates I could contact him and he would help us free of cost. They all agreed this was a great option. 

After contacting my family member, he sent a letter to our landlord. Basically it gave them the legally required time to fix the problem or else our lease would be cancelled after a month from when they received the letter. It also said that it would be best for both parties if they just flat out let us out of the lease. 

After this was explained to me, I went straight to my roommates. My GF and I showed them the letter and asked for their approval. Which they quickly gave us. I told them explicitly there is a chance the lease could end sooner, so look for a place no later than the end of the month. After that my family member sent off the letter. 

A few weeks after this we receive notice the landlord is letting us out of the lease. We need to provide them with the date we will all vacate the apartment. As soon as we heard this we texted our roommates informing them of the situation. My GF and I had found an apartment for the end of the month, as I had informed the others to do as well. We told them we would be moving out at the end of the month and we asked them when  they would like to vacate and end the lease. One roommate then told us it sounded like we had already made a plan and were leaving them “high and dry no matter what”. We then informed her the lease would not end when we left, but instead when they found a new place. In the past we have even offered for them to stay with us at our new place until they can relocate. 
We also told her we would still help clean our part and assist them in moving as much as possible even if we leave first. 

She is currently being distant and somewhat cold to us. We do not want to leave her high and dry in the slightest, but she believes we are. AITA?

tl;dr GF and I gave roommates notice of lease cancellation and told them when to expect to leave. They gave their approval. Lease cancellation comes along weeks later and they say we left them high and dry.

AITA for giving a fake phone number to a foreign family I’ve met for the first (and last) time in my life? | English is not my first language so feel free to correct me.

I was walking back home (near to my flat) when a foreign family showed up and asked me for help. I don’t know where were they from but they were black and this story takes place in middle Europe so they seemed obviously tourists. They asked me how to go to the city centre, get tickets to the public transport and where do they find an accomodation. They didn’t know the city and our local currency (they even asked me what can they buy with that and the cash they had is enough for a hotel room. No it wasn’t.).

I patiently helped them buy tickets at a ticket machine, gave directions to the city centre and assured them that there will be a hotel. They were lost but really nice and I thought why not help them?

But here comes the problem: they wanted me to give them my phone number, so they can call me later for other questions if they are lost.

I was glad to help them but at this point it was enough for me. I saw them for the first time, i didn’t even know them. Anyway, I hate incoming calls, no matter that it’s from a stranger or a family member. 

One of them even hugged me and told me I’m an angel with this lot of help. I didn’t want to hurt them with refusing this request, they were so glad to find someone who helped them in a foreign country. 

Suddenly I had no better idea in that situation so I made an unethical move: I gave them a fake phone number.

I know it wasn’t the best move. Technically I scammed that family. But giving my phone number for someone I met for the first time is too much for me. I was glad to help but I can't carry the burden of everybody on my shoulder.

So tell me fellow Redditors: Am I the asshole for refusing to give my own phone number and giving a fake one instead?

Edit: Correct me. Not collect me.

AITA for not wanting to do my MIL’s laundry? | She hasn’t had a washer and dryer in years, her apartment isn’t set up for one, they have one at her complex but “her wrists are weak” and she “can’t stand for that long,” according to my husband.

Now we have a washer and dryer and I told him I didn’t sign up to do her laundry, so he can bring it over and do it.

AITA for telling my SO I won’t pay his bills anymore? | I (23f) don’t work, I am a full time student and when my dad passed away a few years ago, he left me money to get me through school. He had always said he’d support me financially as long as I was in school so when he got sick, he set aside enough for me to live off for the rest of my undergrad. I had only just started my undergrad then - I was about 6 months in, so I still had a lot ahead of me. I’m am very grateful for him doing this and try to budget it wisely. That leads to me living on about $800/month after rent is due (this includes food, bills, school supplies like textbooks, etc.)

My SO (22m) and I have been dating almost two years now and living together since last fall - about 6 months now. I don’t charge him rent, make him pay any bills, I buy most of the groceries, and he uses the money from his part time job to buy extra stuff like take-out food, cigarettes, gas for his car, etc. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but I also started paying all of HIS bills at some point soon after we moved in. I now also pay for his phone bill, his car insurance, his doctors appointments, and will send him money for stuff here and there, like when he got hit and busted his headlight. 

I’ve sat down with him several times over the course of the last several months and said I can’t keep paying these for him. At this rate, I’m almost doubling the monthly amount I use from my savings fund with his bills included, and I won’t have enough to get me through my undergrad. So I told him this morning I wasn’t willing to help with his bills anymore. 

I feel like the asshole and I know he thinks I’m the asshole for deciding to do this right now. He only works about 20 hours a week now but looking for another job during this time isn’t going to be easy. He has car insurance coming up at the end of the month and his job requires him to have a car so he has to at least get that paid. But I have been trying to set my foot down for months, something I’m admittedly not good at doing, and I cannot afford to be using this much money a month. I am perfectly fine with continuing to pay rent, bills, food, etc. all on my own. But I don’t want to be paying bills that don’t even affect me. I never use his car or ask him to drive me anywhere (insurance is $300/mo), he chose a psychiatrist that doesn’t take his insurance ($50/appt), and I feel used because he doesn’t hesitate to ask me for money anymore ($50 here, $70 there). It gets up to about $700-$800 a month when you include things like parking tickets, gas money, phone bill fees, take-out food when he “doesn’t get paid until tomorrow” and is at work, etc. 

Am I being too harsh right now saying “I’m leaving you with all these bills to figure out yourself”? I definitely feel like the asshole but I also feel like he’s using me for money that I shouldn’t be spending at this rate.

Update: Thank you all. I went ahead and broke up with him. I do think, based on how his last relationship went, he would stay with me if I lost all the money, but I don’t think it’s because of love. When discussing this with him and bringing up breaking up, a much bigger issue came up and I realize now the relationship was about control. Again, thank you.

AITA for giving my fiance consequences for not fulfilling a promise? | My fiance (M/22) and I (F/30) have been together for a year now, and during this time he has not had a driver's license. Out of necessity when we first moved in together I bought a car in my name for him so that he could work, with the promise that now that he had income he would go get his license. Added factor in the issue is also that Fiance does have ADHD, and just got treatment for it for the first time in the last 6 months.

 Cut to a year later, he still does not have a license. I finally decided to let him know that he has a month to get his license. During this month I backed off of him, didn't constantly remind him as he requested, and just let him do his thing with the explicit promise that if he did not get his license, he would not be able to use his car and he would be taking the bus. Last week of the month and he still doesn't have his license, hasn't studied for a minute, nothing. He asks me to extend it to yesterday, I do, still nothing. Yesterday I told him that he could not use his car, and that I would not be taking him to work (I am currently at home on medical leave), and he did not react well. He told me that he felt as though not having his car was enough, and that I was going too far by not taking him to work. Today he has declared that if I don't take him to work, he will simply call out.

 I know one thing for sure, I feel like the asshole.

TLDR; fiance hasn't gotten license for a year, I take away car and won't take him to work, he feels me not taking him to work is too far

EDIT: I said in the OP that I felt like TA, and that has been confirmed. 

Just to clarify. I realize there are many factors in our relationship that make it difficult. I am a patient person by nature, and I try to see the best in people and do what I can to be supportive of my loved ones, apparently to a fault. I appreciate the constructive criticism and have begun (and will continue) taking steps to better myself in healthy ways, as well as working with my partner to set healthier boundaries. I understand that my relationship might not make sense to some people, and that's totally fine. We all have different and unique lives and I think that is something to celebrate.


Thank you to everyone for their time and their comments. Everything is something towards learning and growing.

AITA for returning a neighbor’s Amazon delivery. | My neighbor called me and asked if he could order a MacBook Pro for work on my Amazon Prime account. I said yes and asked for his credit card info to make the purchase. He said if He could pay when he comes to pick it up. So when it arrived, I asked him to pay. He then asked if I could pay the whole thing.

With my employee discount, the MAC was fully upgraded and it cost almost $2500. I refused to pay. He said that he need the laptop for work as it was a work from home job. Also his family was financially unstable and I had a high paying salary. All this was true so I tried to compromise.

I said if he choose a less expensive laptop I would pay for it. He kept saying that he needed that specific MacBook Pro. I disagreed and returned the laptop. He told me “good job idiot now my children are going to starve.” The next day is wife called and yelled that her husband lost her job and the lost their only source of money. Many of my neighbors said I was a asshole.

WIBTA If I told a girl I'm seeing that I will not come over again unless she changes the way she treats her living space? | I have been seeing a girl, on and off, for a couple months now. Shes very sweet and nice. But I have been to her place twice, and my god is it awful. The house isn't messy by any means, but the smell is unbearable. She has 4 cats and a dog, that, besides pee and poo, doesn't clean up after. So the whole house smells like cat piss, dog piss, and a litter box all mixed at once. Not only that but she is a smoker, which I am too, but she smokes constantly in the house. All the time. I do not because I think its disgusting.

AITA for not shaving my head for a colleage with cancer? | This happened last year and I only just found this subreddit. Also first ever post so go easy on me.Last year one of my colleagues got diagnosed with testicular cancer and needed to go through chemo.Chemotherapy makes all of your hair fall out in clumps and eventually you wind up bald. Some of my colleagues, both male and female, decided to shave themselves bald to show support.However, I hardly know this colleague (I had only been with the company 2 months) so while I expressed my support and hope he pulls through, I wouldn't be shaving my head.When shaving-day came around, both the colleague and a few others that had shaved themselves expressed they were hurt I hadn't shaved bald and asked what was up.I said I still absolutely support him in every way, but I'm just not shaving myself bald. He seemed offended and the now bald gang said I was being a dick and I might as well laugh in his face. When I asked how come they aren't giving some of the others the same lecture, apparently it was because they were women and ""needed"" the long hair.I'm almost certain I am in the right and they're being unreasonable, but I need a sanity check. Am I the asshole?  


EDIT: Thanks a lot for all the support. Everyone seems over it now, and it's bothered me for a while, it's nice to know I'm not the asshole.

AITA for not shaving my head for a colleage with cancer? | This happened last year and I only just found this subreddit. Also first ever post so go easy on me.Last year one of my colleagues got diagnosed with testicular cancer and needed to go through chemo.Chemotherapy makes all of your hair fall out in clumps and eventually you wind up bald. Some of my colleagues, both male and female, decided to shave themselves bald to show support.However, I hardly know this colleague (I had only been with the company 2 months) so while I expressed my support and hope he pulls through, I wouldn't be shaving my head.When shaving-day came around, both the colleague and a few others that had shaved themselves expressed they were hurt I hadn't shaved bald and asked what was up.I said I still absolutely support him in every way, but I'm just not shaving myself bald. He seemed offended and the now bald gang said I was being a dick and I might as well laugh in his face. When I asked how come they aren't giving some of the others the same lecture, apparently it was because they were women and ""needed"" the long hair.I'm almost certain I am in the right and they're being unreasonable, but I need a sanity check. Am I the asshole?

AITA for sending a nude to an ex-boyfriend who I ran into at REI and he made a shitty remark about me losing weight? Husband is pissed. | Friday I was at REI by myself. I ran into an ex boyfriend who id lived with for 4 years when I was in my early 20s (I'm 31 now). He was with this enormous woman and because he's still an immature slob, he was trying to act overly affectionate with her pretending like he didn't see me. He was in line behind (alone) me and he said hello. I said nice to see you too. He said somthing about losing weight. I said yeah I finally got my act in gear and do triahtlons and marathons now. He said I want my girlfriend to lose weight but I'm worried what would happen to her boobs. I said boobs are just fine if not better than before. He said well they don't look good from here. I was like wow you are still an asshole and I'm not 19 and able to be negged anymore. He said I was still a greedy piece of shit by my ring and the expensive camping mat I was buying. I turned around and ignored his continued comments.

It just ate at me all night so I texted a friend to see if she still had his number, she did so I took a topless mirror selfie and sent it to him. I captioned it ""does moo-cow's udders look this good!"" He just texted me back ""blocked"" which really made me laugh. 

I thought my husband would find it amusing because it's in the vein of his sense of humor but he was really pissed. He said he understood my desire to get back at David but that I went way too far in sending him the topless shot. He's not going to divorce me or anything and he's less mad than he was Friday but was I the asshole here?

WIBTA if I report one of my co-workers to HR for frequently not wearing shoes? | One of my co-workers is one of those types who seems to hate shoes and socks. She almost always flip-flops in the warmer time and even now takes hers off and doesn't wear socks. She's kind of short so she'll sometimes kneel in her chair and her soles are very visible, sometimes walks around showing off her cute toes, and in the break room sometimes will lean back in one of the leather chairs and put her feet up on the rest.

So I'm a lesbian (don't talk about it much there or heavily advertise it) and I have a foot fetish. So frankly this gets REALLY distracting. For other WLW/straight guys imagine if a woman at your work liked to take her top off with no bra on and then casually let her boobs hang out. This is about the same for me. And her feet are legitimately very cute and she keeps them in great shape and paints her toes cute colors. It's enjoyable yet driving me crazy. I try not to do anything creepy or that I know would make straight women uncomfortable but this is kind of unavoidable.

She's technically violating dress code, so telling HR and them telling her she has to keep her shoes on is an option....but that's so Karen-esque and it seems wrong to report someone who hasn't really hurt anyone or to force her to wear shoes just because I don't have enough self control to ignore her. And just talking to her and asking it is needless to say something I'm too embarrassed to do (""oh hey could you please keep your shoes on or feet out of site? I like girls and have a foot fetish, it's distracting me so much."" Mortifying.)

So would reporting her be an asshole move?

AITA for asking why he flushed the toilet multiple times. | It was a family dinner and movie night with the extended family.  Cousin went to bathroom.  At our house we can hear whenever the toilet flushes from the dinner room.  He flushed the toilet 4-5 times over a period of 5-10 minuets.  When he returned I asked him why he flushed the toilet so many times.  He said and sounded very embaressed that it was because the toilet wasn't flushing all the way.  It became super awkward and I felt kind of embaressed.  AITA?

AITA For not wanting my stepdad to be in the same room with me while I’m changing | Ok I know how it sounds but I’m not all innocent either

Me: 15 y/o Male
Him: 47 y/o Male

Now let me preface this story by saying he’s not a bad stepdad I love him and he’s given this family so much and gotten us out of most of our debt, I’ve known him since 6th grade up until now in 9th grade and he’s a good person.

 Today we had to go get my physical but neither of us knew that coming in, we thought we would just pick up my pills and leave.

But this had to be done and I had to strip to my underwear, I asked him if he could leave the room but he said no. The convo went a little like this

Me: Can you leave the room?

SD: no I can stay here

Me: *raising my voice*I don’t feel comfortable with you watching me

SD: You used to walk around all the time in your underwear, but I told you to stop because of your sister

This was true I did use to do that but I still wouldn’t budge.

Me: cmon just for second

SD: I’ll look down at my phone I’m not even watching you

Eventually I just undressed and got my physical done, he later told me that I shouldn’t have had an attitude with him, we got into a huge argument and I’m upset about it.

So AITA

Edit: I spoke with SD and after explaining some more that I didn’t mean to have an attitude and how I felt he understood, he said he was sorry and apologized and I apologized for raising my voice at him. Everything is all good with us now thank you so much for the closure :)

AITA for saying I'd hate myself if I was a minimum wage worker? | I work as a 3D artist, I don't even make a lot, like 50k a year but I use to work as Cap 2 (stocking job) at Wal-Mart to make some income instead of sitting in my butt all day while I was looking for a new position and hated it. I was out with my friend shopping and we were having a conversation about work life and he said something about minimum wage and all I said is I would hate myself if I was working minimum wage.

One of the stockers overheard me and gave me this mean look. I didn't even mean to target minimum wage workers, I was actually referring to myself and my own standards so it wasn't meant as a personal attack or anything, I didn't even know the guy.

My friend understood what I meant but told me it wasn't the smartest idea to say that in that kind of work environment especially around an employee (didn't see him at first) but I feel like instead of concentrating on other people's conversation he should just work and mind his own business so that things like that don't happen.

There’s this guy at work who I used to have a crush on but he turned out to be a real whiner/jerk.  I asked him to go get coffee one day so we could get to know each other better. So basically we went on a date and he was telling me all this personal shit that I did not want to hear about. He told me about some of his exes and about how he hates his siblings. I was really pissed off and said dude, this is a first date, I’m not your therapist. I don’t care about you at all”. He got pissed and said you “wanted to me know me better, so why are you getting pissy when I’m giving something you asked. 

Things were getting pretty heated at that point and he left since people were starting to look. I texted him the next day saying that he never would get any girls in his life after his behavior on the date. He said he didn’t want to hear from me anymore and if I ever contacted him again outside work he would contact the police and file harassment charges.

AITA for calling my ex-wife and kids for dinner? | This story sounds super f***ed up and fake, but bare with me please. I really need a verdict on this.

**Backstory:**
I (now 47M) had a bad habit of drinking. In the last couple months of my 18 year relationship with my ex-wife (now 45F), I began to drink and go partying a lot outside of my workdays, and I would often return home so late and my wife wasn't cool with it at all. She tried taking me to rehab to get fixed up, but I was stupid and denied to go. I believed it wouldn't do anything to change me so there was no point going and it was a waste of time. She threatened me so many times that if I don't change my ways, we would divorce. I promised I would, but I was that big of an addict to just continue doing what I done.

My wife eventually had enough and packed her bags, took our 3 kids (15M, 11F, 8F) and moved out from my house to her brother's house. And I tried to get her back, but she refused and that was that. We divorced, and she used my drinking habit to get full custody of our children. I cannot mention how devastated and heartbroken I was, but I guess I have no one to blame but me for my stupid, idiotic actions and demeanor. 3 years later, she moved on and remarried another man and I decided to remain single. I've managed to get a grip and stop my unhealthy habit, but a little too late unfortunately.

My kids, with my ex-wife's permission of course, still come over and visit me once every few months and they still love and miss me despite being fully aware of what happened. They tell me how their step-dad isn't the same, how torn apart they are and how they want the ""good ol' days back with mum and I"".  I can't help but hate myself whenever I hear them talk about this. After 3 years, I finally felt I owed something to my ex and kids after how I abandoned them.

So recently, I called my ex-wife and asked if it would be OK if all of us go out on one last special dinner to ""remove the bad taste I left in everyone's mouths"" and she didn't exactly jump to the idea and was super hesitant and uncomfortable about it. I didn't press the issue and waited. I was about to hang up and take it as a no, until her current husband picked up and told me to f*** off and how disrespectful I am for calling his wife. Then, as if to rub salt in my wounds, he said ""you should've been a better father to your kids and a better husband."" and hung up. (Frankly, i was not surprised he knew)

I regret my actions even more now and I feel so miserable now. I had good intentions, but it looks like I messed up by calling. Maybe I shouldn't have called at all. AITA?

In the last couple months of my 18 year relationship with my ex-wife (now 45F), I began to drink and go partying a lot outside of my workdays, and I would often return home so late and my wife wasn't cool with it at all. She tried taking me to rehab to get fixed up, but I was stupid and denied to go. I believed it wouldn't do anything to change me so there was no point going and it was a waste of time. She threatened me so many times that if I don't change my ways, we would divorce. I promised I would, but I was that big of an addict to just continue doing what I done.

My wife eventually had enough and packed her bags, took our 3 kids (15M, 11F, 8F) and moved out from my house to her brother's house. And I tried to get her back, but she refused and that was that. We divorced, and she used my drinking habit to get full custody of our children. I cannot mention how devastated and heartbroken I was, but I guess I have no one to blame but me for my stupid, idiotic actions and demeanor. 3 years later, she moved on and remarried another man and I decided to remain single. I've managed to get a grip and stop my unhealthy habit, but a little too late unfortunately.

My kids, with my ex-wife's permission of course, still come over and visit me once every few months and they still love and miss me despite being fully aware of what happened. They tell me how their step-dad isn't the same, how torn apart they are and how they want the ""good ol' days back with mum and I"".  I can't help but hate myself whenever I hear them talk about this. After 3 years, I finally felt I owed something to my ex and kids after how I abandoned them.

So recently, I called my ex-wife and asked if it would be OK if all of us go out on one last special dinner to ""remove the bad taste I left in everyone's mouths"" and she didn't exactly jump to the idea and was super hesitant and uncomfortable about it. I didn't press the issue and waited. I was about to hang up and take it as a no, until her current husband picked up and told me to f*** off and how disrespectful I am for calling his wife. Then, as if to rub salt in my wounds, he said ""you should've been a better father to your kids and a better husband."" and hung up. (Frankly, i was not surprised he knew)

I regret my actions even more now and I feel so miserable now. I had good intentions, but it looks like I messed up by calling. Maybe I shouldn't have called at all. AITA?

AITA for expecting people to move off the path when I'm running. | I am a runner, currently marathon training, taking it seriously. 

My regular route is along the coast (south England).

It is a narrow tarmac path surrounded either by grass or beach shale. 

To begin with I will acknowledge other pedestrians have equal rights to the path.

Given I'm running at 6mph it is much harder for me to step off the path, higher momentum.

I am wearing road shoes, which are not as suited to mud (it rains a lot in the uk) as the pedestrians walking boots.

I am much more likely to trip or fall on shale or mud going at speed.

Old and disabled people get a free pass obviously, and if you're walking away from me I understand. But if you are walking 2 abreast coming towards me, get in single file or step off the path. Don't just glare me down.

Ps dogs on leads need to be on the same side of the path as owners, or else you are a walking trip wire. 

Update:

It seems I have received a fair bit of internet hate and taken a karma hit. Let me share what I have learnt.

I take the point about ""whoever is the cause of danger should take responsibility for this risk"" and as such I will be dodging when necessary.

I think the ahole judgement is a little misdirected: too much focus on my perceived entitlement to the WHOLE path. Let me clarify I am primarily focussed on groups who walk two abreast and don't drop to single file.

Also to pick up on some of the hate: a lot of people have commented that I should go somewhere else / the path is meant for pedestrians / people just want to enjoy themselves.  To them I respond: I live in the coast my options are either drive somewhere, run through the city or run along the coast, this is my home; I am a pedestrian, I appreciate that bikes and skateboards can be dangerous, I am not a bike ; I am people I also just want to enjoy myself.

I get the feeling that a few people have brought their own experiences to the table when deciding, it sounds like there is a lot of frustration in both directions. So let me remind everyone, in the words of Plato: be kind , for everyone is fighting their own battle .

AITA for encouraging somebody to search for a platonic love? | I have been recently giving advice to a guy who is [trying to contact a girl](https://www.reddit.com/r/es/comments/cnbzum/alguien_puede_ayudarme_a_reconectarme_con_la/) who had met on internet.

He said that talked several times with her through an language interchange application (HelloTalk), and eventually had fallen in love with her, but one day she just disconnected from the app. He knows her name, her city and the faculty there she is currently studying and he is searching for her to say that he miss her (and also probably say he loves her), so I suggested him to travel to that city for two weeks, and try to search for her in the university asking to possible classmates. That will be expensive (about 4000 $), but he says that he can pay for it.

My point of view is... you clearly don't deserve the other person affection if you don't fight for it more that just searching in google and writing in reddit forums. In the worst  case you will lose the money, but you also get the peace of mind of having fight for your dreams come true.

Then, another user in the thread accused him to be a sociopath and a stalker, and me for encouraging his behaviour.

I admitted that from my point of view he has a platonic love, and probably the name of the girl is just an alias used for the application and not her real name, but this should not stop him to resolve his dream for good or for bad. I think that it is better to try to find her, and fight for his dream to come true. I am concerned that he probably won't find the girl, or even he can be rejected, but that still doesn't make him a stalker unless she have asked him to let her in peace.

Am I the Asshole for supporting him and wish good luck with the search, even believing he has low chances to find her?

AITA for taking the car I lent to my mom back? | I have been letting my mom and her boyfriend use my car for the last few weeks. I had no problem with this really, because I was able to share my boyfriend’s car with him because we pretty much have opposite work days. 

Yesterday, I went to my mom’s house to do some laundry, and my little cousin asked me for his vape back (which I confiscated from him because he’s too young). The vape was in the glovebox of the car I lent them, and so I went to check if it was in there because I completely forgot about it when I gave them the car. 

The vape was not in the glovebox anymore, so I figured that they got it out and put it away, assuming it was my cousin’s (he’s been known to acquire them countless times). No big deal, I guess. Expect mild agitation they’re going through my glovebox. 

So I go into the house and ask my mom “Hey have you seen a white vape? It was in my glovebox” and she immediately starts yelling at my cousin, completely ignoring my question. This is usually what she does when she’s lying: yell at anyone she can. So I just redirect the attention to me and say it’s mine now because I took it from them and I am giving it back to my cousin’s friend’s mom, who I’m pretty sure they got it from in the first place.

She claims she has no idea and changes the subject. So I just go into the room where the laundry is and check the drawer where they always put vapes they’ve confiscated. Of course it’s there. 

So I ask her boyfriend (who’s been with her for 11 years) if he knows anything about it, he acts like I’m stupid for even asking. But I already know that it was most likely him, he’s gotten into my glovebox before and found lube I left in there and tells everyone in the world about it. 

At this point he’s  just straight lying to my face and going off on me. Accusing me of snooping in their drawer and saying he has no idea how it got in there. He ends up calling me a “stupid fucking cunt” and I tell them I’m taking my car back since they want to steal and lie about it. 



Okay, this is the part where I feel bad. I took the car back. But it’s the only car they have (besides my sisters who also lives there, but still needs the use of her car). I made sure my sister could drive my mom to work before I took the car. I feel like my mom should’ve defended me after he called me that, instead she just yelled at me and my cousin for starting a problem. Her bf has got dr appointments as well, but I honestly don’t care if he gets to them or not. It’s my mom I feel kind of bad for, but the lack of respect is what made me decide to take the car. 

I just don’t get why they lied even though it was so obvious to everyone in the house that the only one who would’ve taken it out of my car (that they were using) and put it into the drawer (in their bedroom). 

Let me know if I left out anything.

AITA For Calling the Police on my Sister? | So some background here:

I have an older, 21 year old sister who just returned from university abroad back home. She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.

&#x200B;

If I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.

&#x200B;

My parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.

&#x200B;

The part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.

&#x200B;

I got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.

&#x200B;

My parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.

&#x200B;

We have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?

&#x200B;

Edit: 

&#x200B;

Thank you all for the suggestions and help. I spoke with my parents and voiced my concerns. My mom seems to have come to her senses but my dad is still apathetic. I'm packing my bags at crashing at a friend's house until I go back to university. In the long run, I'm not sure what to do. I think a psychiatric ward would be best but there's no way I'll be able to get her to go on my own.

AITA For Calling the Police on my Sister? | So some background here:

I have an older, 21 year old sister who just returned from university abroad back home. She has always been very narcissistic and materialistic but in her time abroad in Australia it's become much, much worse. Her usual habit is to scream and scream and scream like a five year old child whenever she doesn't get whatever she wants - no matter how large or small.

&#x200B;

If I leave my room for five seconds she starts yelling at me to return to my room. If I leave my door open she yells at me to close my door. Every single morning I'm woken up by the sound of her incessant yelling.

&#x200B;

My parents are unwilling to say no. Whenever she yells and throws a temper tantrum my parents cave in and give her whatever she wants. My parents (who are working class) already busted their asses off to fund her lavish lifestyle while studying in Australia. I personally worked incredibly hard to earn a full ride to college so that my parents wouldn't be crippled by dept.

&#x200B;

The part that gets me the most and absolutely boils my blood is that this bitch has the audacity to hit my parents when she doesn't get her way. She will literally physically assault them and destroy property around our home.

&#x200B;

I got sick and tired of it and called the police on her (for a second time) to have her arrested because it was reaching a point where I genuinely feared for the well being of myself and my parents. My sister has threatened to attack us with knives in the past and as a result we no longer keep knives (even to cook) in our home. My sister was arrested once previously for domestic violence and this is her second offense.

&#x200B;

My parents are both very angry at me because, in their eyes, I just ruined her life forever.

&#x200B;

We have tried to get her to see a professional and get some medication to help with her issues but she has refused every time, saying that she's fine and we're the ones in the wrong. Am I the asshole here for wanting to get her out of our lives?

&#x200B;

Edit: 

&#x200B;

Thank you all for the suggestions and help. I spoke with my parents and voiced my concerns. My mom seems to have come to her senses but my dad is still apathetic. I'm packing my bags at crashing at a friend's house until I go back to university. In the long run, I'm not sure what to do. I think a psychiatric ward would be best but there's no way I'll be able to get her to go on my own.

AITA for telling my mom I’d rather eat a frozen meal than her thanksgiving dinner? | I’ll try to keep this short. I don’t eat meat or dairy due to personal reasons.

I don’t feel that it’s morally wrong to consume these products and I don’t have any superiority complex involving my diet. If someone specifically asks me about the motives behind my dietary choices, I will answer them, but I don’t go out of my way to bring it up. 

I live with my parents so they are well aware of my diet. 

Anyway, last week my mom started discussing the thanksgiving menu. She said she planned to make a roast turkey, sausage stuffing, mashed potatoes (butter/milk) and then asked me if I would make some sides as well. I told her sure, I guess I could roast some vegetables alongside some meatless chicken tenders in the oven. She got really offended and said “really? You’re going to sit at thanksgiving dinner with a frozen meal and a chip on your shoulder?” I was kind of taken off guard because my mom is more than used to me cooking dinner for myself. I typically cook with a lot whole Foods and make more elaborate salads, stews, pasta dishes, etc. but since my mom is going to be cooking all day I just figured I’d keep it simple. 

I eventually asked her, point blank, what exactly she wanted me to do. Did she want me to eat her roast turkey? Because that’s not something I want to do. She said no, she didn’t expect that, but I could at least put the effort into making myself a presentable meal for thanksgiving. 

Personally I feel she’s asking a lot considering she’s not actually helping to accommodate my dietary habits (not that I’d expect her to. But I feel I should get free reign since she isn’t). WIBTA if I make “chicken” tenders for thanksgiving dinner? Or should I comply with my mom’s wishes?

AITA for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to my brother’s wedding before his fiancé dies? | My brother is getting married to his fiancé, who has terminal brain cancer. He’s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he’s getting the marriage purely because she’s dying but I wouldn’t dream of saying that to anybody involved).

They’re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don’t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I’d be too hot to be comfortable.

AITA for continuing to hang out with an unhappily married man? | Throwaway account here. I (19F) am working at an internship this summer in a new state. I'm meeting many talented people in my field and am learning a lot from them. One of these people is a 27M. He's been a great mentor and is interesting to talk to. We've worked together on some projects and hung out quite a few times. In the process, I've learned he's extremely unsatisfied in his marriage. They want completely different things in life, opposite personalities, not to mention he kind of rushed into the marriage. Right now, she lives extremely far away, so they aren't seeing each other. Every time we hang out I get increasingly more suspicious that he likes me. The fact that he's married is the only thing that keeps me from being 100% certain he likes me. He keeps asking me to go out after work, and eventually, I end up saying yes. On one hand, he's a co-worker and a potential connection for the future, and suddenly cutting it off could have consequences (especially if we work together in the future). Plus, it's nice to be treated to food, and I know for a fact I'm safe when I'm with him (let's just say this is a hypothetical condition). Also, like I said, he is a nice person to talk to, especially when I'm alone here otherwise. But to be clear, I have no intention of pursuing anything with a married man. On the other hand, I feel like an asshole for continuing to go out with him. Obviously if I were in his wife's situation, I wouldn't like me at all. But I don't consider what I'm doing to be stringing him along since 1) I'm so many years his junior and think that'd be a huge assumption considering the work situation we're in, 2) I've specified many times I consider him a friend. Am I in the wrong for continuing to go out with him?

Tldr; AITA for continuing to go out with an unhappily married man with romantic feelings for me for free food and company?

EDIT: I described my work as an internship, but to clarify a bit more, it's a research internship. The 27M is a graduate student, and I am an undergraduate student. He is not a formal mentor of any kind. I'm trying not to give too many incriminating details, but I'm curious to see if this makes a difference. Also, I think a lot of people are taking my Tldr; more seriously than intended. It's my sarcastic way of describing the situation 😅

AITA for continuing to hang out with an unhappily married man? | Throwaway account here. I (19F) am working at an internship this summer in a new state. I'm meeting many talented people in my field and am learning a lot from them. One of these people is a 27M. He's been a great mentor and is interesting to talk to. We've worked together on some projects and hung out quite a few times. In the process, I've learned he's extremely unsatisfied in his marriage. They want completely different things in life, opposite personalities, not to mention he kind of rushed into the marriage. Right now, she lives extremely far away, so they aren't seeing each other. Every time we hang out I get increasingly more suspicious that he likes me. The fact that he's married is the only thing that keeps me from being 100% certain he likes me. He keeps asking me to go out after work, and eventually, I end up saying yes. On one hand, he's a co-worker and a potential connection for the future, and suddenly cutting it off could have consequences (especially if we work together in the future). Plus, it's nice to be treated to food, and I know for a fact I'm safe when I'm with him (let's just say this is a hypothetical condition). Also, like I said, he is a nice person to talk to, especially when I'm alone here otherwise. But to be clear, I have no intention of pursuing anything with a married man. On the other hand, I feel like an asshole for continuing to go out with him. Obviously if I were in his wife's situation, I wouldn't like me at all. But I don't consider what I'm doing to be stringing him along since 1) I'm so many years his junior and think that'd be a huge assumption considering the work situation we're in, 2) I've specified many times I consider him a friend. Am I in the wrong for continuing to go out with him?

Tldr; AITA for continuing to go out with an unhappily married man with romantic feelings for me for free food and company?

AITA for not letting my son call his bio mom's son his ""brother""? | My husband and I adopted our son as an infant. It's always been an open adoption, exchanging regular pictures and letters and stuff like that. Once our son turned 13, he started having more one-on-one contact with his bio mom. They text regularly, and they've hung out in person many times. My son is now 16, so their relationship has only gotten closer over the last three years.

His bio mom got married two years ago, and last year had a son with her husband. Last week, for the first time, my son went and visited his bio mom along with her husband and baby. They went to an amusement park, and apparently had a good time. 

When he got home, my son kept talking about how cute his ""brother"" was, and how much he enjoyed meeting him. Eventually, I snapped and told him that he shouldn't call the baby his ""brother,"" since that implies that they share a parent, which they don't. His bio mom isn't his mom, I am. 

I understand that it's important for him to maintain a friendship with his bio mom, but that's exactly what it is – friendship. They're not his family, so it's inappropriate for him to refer to the baby that way. 

My son is now furious with me, and my husband refuses to give his opinion on the matter.

AITA for pushing for foods that myself and coworker are allergic to be banned? | Hi all! I am incredibly allergic to avocados. If I am in the same room as in that’s been cut open I break out in hives and my throat swells. I am allergic to many different fruits, but avocados are the worst.

My other coworker, let’s call him Mike, is allergic to peppers in the same way.

Most people in my workplace are very respectful of our allergies, and don’t eat anything or cut anything around us that we’re allergic to. Except this one woman, let’s call her Katherine. 

Katherine regularly brings in guacamole, whole avocados, etc. she tells me just to not eat any, despite me constantly telling her that being around that is bad. I’ve had bad reactions at work because of this. Last week, Mike walked into the kitchen and Katherine was cutting up some bell peppers. Immediate anaphylaxis for Mike. Katherine was complaining about it, saying she has a right to eat what she wants where and when she wants.

AITA for telling my wife I’m worried about her health? | Using a throwaway because my wife knows my public.

First off, I love my wife. We’ve been married for a little over 18 months now and things couldn’t be better. However, she just left the house to go stay with her sister over a conversation and she says I’m in the wrong. So, into the story.

My wife loves mashed potato with butter. I work nights,  so she makes dinner for herself most of the time. Every night that she cooks for herself she’ll have a whole potato with whatever protein and greens, usually zucchini. 

She isn’t overweight or obese, but before we met she was. She loves her body now and of course I do to. But I’m really worried that this is could cause her to slip back on all the great work she’s done, and frankly I don’t know if a whole potato a day is good for her health. We both have today off (I have tonight off work) so I tried to bring this up with her gently, and suggested maybe taking a week off the potato and seeing how she feels. I also said I could bulk cook some meals on the weekend for her so she wouldn’t have to fall back on starchy white potatoes.

She was really upset and kept asking me if I was saying she was getting fat - I told her that I loved her and was just worried for her health in the future. We didn’t really fight about it, but she decided to stay at her sisters tonight, which means I won’t see her until after I finish my shift tomorrow night at the least. 

Should I have just kept my mouth shut?

EDIT: I get it. I suck. I’ll apologise when she comes home. Cheers.

AITA for refusing to celebrate Christmas? | Hey guys.

My name is Jason (50M) (wow when did I get that old?)  and I live with my wonderful girlfriend Jessie (47F). She has three grown children all attending college. Before I met Jessie I was married. We were high school sweethearts and had two beautiful boys together. On Christmas Eve twenty years ago they were sadly in a fatal car accident and in one day I lost everything.

In all honesty I haven’t celebrated Christmas since. I’ve come a long way, but celebrating Christmas makes me sick to my stomach. Just thinking about my boys, thinking about the day I lost them and how they’ll never experience another Christmas makes me want to... I just don’t want to go there.

My girlfriend is an incredible support for me. She’s helped me with so much, and in a way I think she has brought me back to life. Her patience, her caring, her love. I could live a millions lifetimes and I still wouldn’t deserve it. She is a Christmas nut, but all ten years we’ve been together she’s let me do my thing. Disappear just before Christmas and return once it’s over. However this year she’s been pushing me to stay at home. Telling me how much the kids would appreciate me being there. How we need to spend it as a family. That I need to move on.

I realize that it has been 20 years, and I think she might be correct in what she’s saying. So I’m asking you, strangers of Reddit, Am I the asshole for not celebrating Christmas with my family?

AITA for asking the kid I was watching to leave his video games at home? | I have a friend from work who asked if I could watch her 7 year old son for the week (the school week, 4 days) because she had to go out of town on a work emergency and didn’t have time to line up an overnight sitter. 

My kids are on good terms with her son and he goes to my kids school so there wouldn’t be any extra driving, I told her no problem. 

She brought him over and started unloading a bunch of video gaming equipment. 

I asked that she not leave that stuff because my kids aren’t allowed video games yet (they’re 7 and 5 and when we spend money on a game console we want them to be a little older and better able to enjoy and maintain it, also my 7yo is ADHD and we’re waiting for him to get a little better with time management and self regulation) so it would create an awkward situation for me. 

She said “well this is really all he does” and I said not to worry I’d be sure he felt included and engaged with whatever my kids had going on. 

She said she couldn’t leave him here if he couldn’t play his video games. I said that seemed kind of silly but if she really felt that way I would understand and respect her decision. She said but she doesn’t have another sitter so can I please just take him and the games. I said the logistical challenge was just too much to take on right now. 

She left. I feel badly now. On the one hand it would’ve been a nightmare in the weeks after this kid left dealing with my kids begging to buy a video gaming system. Four days didn’t seem like that long to ask her to leave them at her house. AITA?

AITA For asking why my friend rejected another friend for a date? | Me and and a coworker ( I'll call him Billy ) were both rejected by two other female coworkers at our job. We both took it  a little hard, so we talked to each other.

I asked Billy what reason, if any, did she ( I will call her Bridget ) give. He claimed she just wasn't interested as she was joining the army soon. HOWEVER we both knew she went on a date with some random guy outside of work about a week after rejecting Billy. Bridget didn't seem like an asshole, so I was very curious why she lied.

I decided to ask Bridget about the situation herself, because the reason she gave billy didn't make sense since she shortly went on a date after. I made it clear from the start she didn't have to share anything with me if so didn't want to. She got defensive and without showing the text itself, here is what she said:

**1) Bridget could never give Billy the attention/time he deserves**

**2) That Billy should talk to her directly, instead of sending me ( which he didn't )**

**3) \* WORD FOR WORD \* ""So maybe men should listen more often when a girl is not interested, she's absolutely not interested  ""**

I replied with the following

**1) I'm sure he listened, but rejection can be hard for certain men**

**2) That Billy might be emotionally charged at the moment and talking so soon might be a bad idea**

She then replied with:

**1) That she doesn't need me judging her**

**2) It's none of my business**

**3) To forget about it because everything is fine**

I finished the conversation with saying:

**1) Not to be so defensive, that i'm not judging her**

**2) I only asked out of concern**

**3) She had the option not to tell me anything**

**4) We don't need to talk about this any more**

A few hours later I get a call from Billy asking if I told her anything. I told him the truth, which was that I only talked about what me and Bridget talk about one on one, nothing new from Billy ( everyone knew how he felt in our "" group ).

He tells me that Bridget cried at work and thinks that Billy hates her. He threatened me with violence and I told him I didn't mean to hurt Bridget or him. He kept pushing me so I told him he wasn't thinking properly and that if he didn't want to talk to me that was fine and that I wished him the best. He blocked me soon after.

I apologized to Bridget, saying how I regretted the outcome. Billy still hasn't talked to me and while it hurts to lose a friend, I consider it his decision more so than my own.

I've talked to mutual friends about this and they said I had good intentions, but I should have backed off somewhere in the middle. One friend suggested that me trying to solve/understand Billy's problem was my own way of trying to combat my own emotions regarding my own rejection.

So with all of this in mind am I the asshole in the situation?

AITA for putting disposable silverware in my room after a party? | We had a going-away party for some flatmates awhile back and I bought a big pack of disposable silverware ($20) for the event. Everyone else also pitched in with cooking, buying food, and other necessities for the event.

The large pack of silverware was kept in the kitchen for weeks following the party, and people kept using them out of convenience when all our other normal silverware was in the dishwasher. I didn't like how wasteful they were (even if they wash the recyclable silverware when they are done with them), so I asked them not to do that. 

The next week, when I saw them do it again, I explained that the silverware was meant for parties and similar events and should not be used for anything else. I then took the silverware box into my room (which is still over a half full). 

My housemates are annoyed with me because they think that once we all contribute to the expenses of a party, the materials belong to everyone, and what I'm doing is selfish. I don't agree. It's mine isn't it, I paid for it. I should be able to determine what it's used for.

The large pack of silverware was kept in the kitchen for weeks following the party, and people kept using them out of convenience when all our other normal silverware was in the dishwasher. I didn't like how wasteful they were (even if they wash the recyclable silverware when they are done with them), so I asked them not to do that. 

The next week, when I saw them do it again, I explained that the silverware was meant for parties and similar events and should not be used for anything else. I then took the silverware box into my room (which is still over a half full). 

My housemates are annoyed with me because they think that once we all contribute to the expenses of a party, the materials belong to everyone, and what I'm doing is selfish. I don't agree. It's mine isn't it, I paid for it. I should be able to determine what it's used for. 

AITA?

AITA for making my kid walk with blisters? | Posted for a friend..
We are a very outdoorsy family and enjoy hiking.  About 4 weeks ago, we were going on a family hike and I told my 8 yr old to get their socks and boots on because we were going for a walk in the woods.  After just a short while walking, I notice my daughter limping. I ask whats wrong. She says the back of her feet hurt. We sit down and I pull off her boots and lo and behold, she’s not wearing socks and has massive blisters on both feet.  I give her the “ This is why you need to mind me when I tell you to put socks on” talk. The blisters are painful so I give her a piggy back ride ( in spite of a work related back injury) to the car and everyone’s fun is cut short.
Last weekend we go for another hike and I remind her to put socks on because she doesn’t want blisters again. .... but I’ll bet you can guess what happened.  
I was so irritated I made her walk back to the car and refused to carry her.  My mom said it was an asshole move but I say an 8 yr is old enough to show some common sense and she was just getting the results of her actions.   AITA?

Edit: because everyone keeps asking the same few questions: 
it was a short distance ( 5-10 minutes) 

I’m the sole breadwinner in my household and lugging a 70 lb kid on my back over uneven ground wasn’t a great idea.  I work a physically demanding job and last time I messed up my back I was out of work for weeks.  The first time it happened it was a longer distance over flat even ground so it was a reasonable risk. 

The reason she didn’t put on socks the second time was because it was a different pair of boots and she said she thought since they were fuzzy inside, she didn’t need socks and “ she just didn’t feel like it” 
I physically handed her her socks and boots but had to use the bathroom and when I came back, the boots were on her feet and the socks were gone, so I’m my mind it was a reasonable assumption to make that the socks were on her feet. I found out later she’d tossed them under a chair.

AITA for calling vegans “glorified picky eaters” ? | So this happened at lunar new year.  

Characters: Younger Cousin (lets call her Emily), other younger cousin (Alex), and me.

Context: Alex is 7, and a pretty picky eater. Nothing crazy, just can’t get him to try new stuff much. Emily is 14, and a die-hard vegan. I’m 19, and the oldest person at the kids table (so no adults to manage) (it goes by generations, so that’s why I’m there)

About a month before, Emily had told us to make sure there was vegan dishes she could eat. Alright, we could deal with that. We also knew Alex was a picky eater, so we accommodated for that too (which really took no effort at all, he likes the traditional food we make)

So we’re at the dinner, and Alex is refusing to try a vegetable dish, but eating everything else. Perfectly expected, no big deal, he just won’t touch it, he doesn’t make a fuss about it. Until Emily decides to call him out. “Alex, eat the vegetables. All the aunts and Uncles and cousins took the time to make the food.” And she nags like this for a few minutes. I eventually get tired of this and go “Emily, you’re trying less of what’s on the table than he is, go back to your food.” She responds with “well I’m a vegan. He’s just being a picky eater” I point at the 2 vegan dishes that before this point would not have been vegan. “You realize we had to take the time to change two dishes just for you right? From the kitchen, Veganism is just picky eating, and you were more of a hassle than he was.” 

And she goes crazy, calling me an environment killer, no respect to other cultures, “some people need to eat vegan for health” NONE OF WHICH IS RELEVANT TO HER, she did it cause her friends did it (I got this straight from her mom’s mouth).

And that’s basically the end. I just shut her out and went back to eating my duck and chicken. So reddit. AITA?

Edit: I guess it’s reasonable to add this. The amount of dishes they both try is relevant conversation. My family has a tradition of everyone above 16 try every dish out of respect to the people who took the time to make it, and children younger than 16 are encouraged to try as many as possible for the same reason. (She’s our first vegan/vegetarian, and first with any dietary restrictions whatsoever, it may become very messy when she turns 16)

AITA for not wanting kids but donating my eggs? | I am a 26 year old single woman. My most recent relationship ended because I am sure that I don’t want to have kids. It has put a strain on every romantic relationship I’ve had and now it is having a negative impact on my family relationships also. I am healthy and relatively attractive with no family history of genetic illnesses so I have decided to donate my eggs. I made the decision to tell my family about this and have gotten nothing but grief about it. My mother says I am being selfish because I am giving her grandchildren that she’ll never get to know. I have an older married sibling that doesn’t want kids either but  my mother has yet to talk down to them about their choices. I feel so good being able to donate my eggs to people that want to have children but can’t do it on their own but my mom makes me feel like shit about it. I’ve distanced myself from her during this time because she is so negative about it. So far I have helped 3 people create families they so desperately want. Should I just tell my mom to F off? Ugh.

AITA for not wanting kids but donating my eggs? | I am a 26 year old single woman. My most recent relationship ended because I am sure that I don’t want to have kids. It has put a strain on every romantic relationship I’ve had and now it is having a negative impact on my family relationships also. I am healthy and relatively attractive with no family history of genetic illnesses so I have decided to donate my eggs. I made the decision to tell my family about this and have gotten nothing but grief about it. My mother says I am being selfish because I am giving her grandchildren that she’ll never get to know. I have an older married sibling that doesn’t want kids either but  my mother has yet to talk down to them about their choices. I feel so good being able to donate my eggs to people that want to have children but can’t do it on their own but my mom makes me feel like shit about it. I’ve distanced myself from her during this time because she is so negative about it. So far I have helped 3 people create families they so desperately want. Should I just tell my mom to F off? Ugh.
Question: Is it Ethical?
I asked a friend the same question and they answered no. I also asked an LLM and it answered yes.

AITA for ""cheating"" at fighting games? | This argument is super dumb and that's why my bf and I decided to ask Reddit instead of arguing about it ourselves on who is in the right and who is wrong lol. 

Alright for obvious reasons we like many other people right now are cooped up in our apartment to pass the time and have some fun we decided to play video games together. The type of games we each like is very different from one another I prefer RPG and fighting games while he prefers MMOs, FPS, and strategy games. Nothing wrong with liking one or the other it's just how it is so no big deal. 

To be a good sport I played a few FPS games with him, I suck at FPS hands down no argument and he was talking mad shit during the game. Doesn't bother me at all that he was because again I get it I suck get all turned around and shoot the wrong way lol. He kept saying things like sucks to suck, you ain't got shit. You know normal shit talk. 

So after taking a break, I suggested we play some of the games I like to play in particular a few fighting games. In case you're wondering MK XL, DOA 6, Tekken 7, and Soulcalibur 6. 

Right off the bat again he was talking shit so I started talking it back to him and I admittedly backed him into corners. I used the terrain of the game to block him in and wail on him. I grew up playing the original street fighter so AFAIK it's a completely valid tactic to use when fighting. I mean the CPU does it itself.

Well after a few rounds of each game he kept getting mad at me doing this telling me to back off. And saying repeatedly that I was ""cheating"" and using cheap moves. I told him I'm not cheating you just suck mad salty sweaty swinging donkey balls at these games. Well now he thinks I'm a cheating AH who played unfairly and made it so that he was unable to enjoy playing because of ""cheating""/talking shit and playing cheap moves. But I don't think I was because again I'm using the mechanics of the game, not some cheat code. He talked shit and I didn't bitch plus the age-old adage "" don't start none won't be none."" So Reddit which one of us is the AH here him or me?

AITA for telling my girlfriend that my family will always come before her and our future together? | My girlfriend expects me to build a future for us.

A little back story:

She's a student right now and works part time but barely makes enough to pay her rent/school fees.

I'm 24 and work a minimum wage + commission job, I have barely any money saved so she doesn't understand why I spend so much money/time with family 

We've been dating 3 years with no problems except for this, we love each other and live independent lives but she worries that I'm too focused on helping my family and making them happy instead of building a future for us. She's working as much as she can to pay her bills but because shes a student and also doing her required interning she can't work much more. She doesnt ever ask me for money to help her right now because she wants me to save up.

She doesn't have a family like mine so she doesn't understand, my family is close and I really want to take care of them. She says that I'm supposed to be worrying about my own future right now. She says that she doesn't understand because my mom recently received about ~100k for a settlement and bought a house and a new car and I shouldn't be worrying about helping when they seem fine.

She is angry that I dont take my life seriously, I've been trying to get my real estate license for a few months now but cant find the time to study because of how demanding my family is, they get really angry/sad when I'm not around for family events and I understand why, we're a close family. I get where shes coming from but I cant drop my family. I told her all of this and she got angry saying that shes not asking me to abandon my family, she just wants to make sure we have a solid foundation before we worry about helping my family. And I cant build a future if I'm always with them.

She expects me to start saving up money for a downpayment on a house while she finishes and gets her degree and can start helping as well but I keep telling her my family needs me first. 

We had a particularly heated fight, the worst we've ever had last night and she said she feels like I'll never care enough about my future and I'm supposed to be building one for myself and her and she can't be with someone like that. She said if I really feel like helping my family comes before my own future than that is my choice but she's going to have no choice but to worry about herself from now on and plan a future where shes her only priority because I make it sound like I don't want to be part of it. 

Shes stopped mentioning anything about it and is now talking about saving up for a one bedroom apartment and a car for herself (she lives in a basement). She seems so sad but I cant help but feel like shes wrong for even asking me to not help my family. 

I dont know if I'm being an asshole or not for telling her that my family will always come first.

AITA for being upset with my boyfriend's 'prank' | I'm still not sure if I'm really in the wrong here or if I was overreacting.

So we just had some roommates move in yesterday. It's a guy I've known for a few years and his girlfriend. So I was sitting on the couch watching football and talking to them when my boyfriend told me he was taking our dog and his mom's dog (who we're dog sitting) on a walk. I said that was fine but be careful since walking two dogs can be more of a pain.

So he gets back from his walk and he only walks in with his mom's dog. He says 'other dog broke the harness and ran away, come help me find him.'

So I was freaking out at this point and asked, 'he ran away?' and he told me 'yes he's loose somewhere.' so I jumped up, ran and grabbed my shoes and sprinted out the door to find him. On my way out I asked the girlfriend to watch things while we go look. 

As I got in my car my boyfriend showed me the dog was in the backyard.

 Now I was super embarrassed in front of the new people in our home. I told him don't ever do that, that wasn't funny to me, it was just embarrassing. He told me it was just a joke and to get over it basically

AITA for being upset with my boyfriend's 'prank' | I'm still not sure if I'm really in the wrong here or if I was overreacting.

So we just had some roommates move in yesterday. It's a guy I've known for a few years and his girlfriend. So I was sitting on the couch watching football and talking to them when my boyfriend told me he was taking our dog and his mom's dog (who we're dog sitting) on a walk. I said that was fine but be careful since walking two dogs can be more of a pain.

So he gets back from his walk and he only walks in with his mom's dog. He says 'other dog broke the harness and ran away, come help me find him.'

So I was freaking out at this point and asked, 'he ran away?' and he told me 'yes he's loose somewhere.' so I jumped up, ran and grabbed my shoes and sprinted out the door to find him. On my way out I asked the girlfriend to watch things while we go look. 

As I got in my car my boyfriend showed me the dog was in the backyard.

 Now I was super embarrassed in front of the new people in our home. I told him don't ever do that, that wasn't funny to me, it was just embarrassing. He told me it was just a joke and to get over it basically 

AITA for being upset with him over his 'prank'?

AITA for not calling my in-laws mom/dad? | My husband and I have been together for 3 years but only married for 1. 

I’ve never really gotten along with them, and they never really had a great opinion about me either... which I never understood because I always tried to connect with them. 

but one day I was called out by my in-laws because I always address them as “uncle/aunty” (it’s a normal thing from where we’re from to call people aunty/uncle). 

They said I NEED to call them “mom/dad”. My husband doesn’t think it’s a big deal to call them mom/dad, but apparently they do... AITA???

AITA for continually telling my husband not to 'groom' himself whenever we're in the car, for the past year or so? | I noticed 3+ years ago that my husband has this habit of constantly grabbing and hand-brushing his beard hair, over and over and over like he's slow-petting a cat on his face, when he's in the car. As such, he hardly ever lets his hand down while driving-- one hand on the steering, one hand on the beard. [edit: this has gone on for entire 8-hour road trips] **[edit 2: It's not just stroking, sorry. It's often reallllly getting deep in there to find 'hard hairs' for him to finger-pluck. It's like an endless beard excavation.** Maybe my inadequate previous description explains why people didn't understand why it was gross to me? Sorry.]

I always see these motions out of my peripheral vision and it's really not attractive. It's like monkey grooming behavior, so I call it 'grooming'. [edit: he doesn't actually do it for grooming purposes... it's just a mindless behavior [edit 2: unless he finds a hard hair lol, sorry this is contradictory to explain, but 99% ends up being pointless digging around if you get what i mean]]

I finally said something about a year+ ago. I told him what he's doing, and I asked very gently for him to not do it. He apologized and said he wouldn't.

Now a year+ has passed and he still does it, every. time. So I mention it maybe 1 out of every 5 car trips. Every time he apologizes but then honestly gets quite embarrassed, as well as angry about it. 

But he still grooms! He did just this morning and I pointed it out and we had this long argument about whether or not I'm a bitch for it.

AITA for continuing to tell him not to groom?

WIBTA if I hid common space items from my roommate until she pays the rent without reminding her that rent is due? | Long time lurker, first time poster. My roommate (25F) and I (23F) are both graduate students, so money isn't just flowing in. However, we both get monthly stipends that are enough to cover all of our bills. My name is listed as the primary person on our bills since she is an international student and wasn't in the country to set these things up, so I pay the bills by the 1st and she is supposed to pay me back. 

I didn't think this would be an issue since most adults that rent spaces know that rent is usually due on the first. But every single month (without fail) she doesn't pay me her share of the bills until days after theyre due. Even then, I have to remind her that rent is due and she owes me money every month. She's rented from someone in the US before and she has plenty of money saved up for ""travel"" so the concept of rent and money aren't an issue for her. It's literally just that she doesn't remember or at least says she doesn't remember. We have a whiteboard with the breakdown of bills in the wall right by the kitchen that she sees every morning so there is a constant reminder there. 

I've kind of hit a breaking point here with her financially. It took her 2 months to get me the money she owed from the deposit and first month of rent back in August. I had to literally beg her and tell her I only had like 80 bucks left for the month two weeks into January because she hadnt paid me back. After this, she said that she set a monthly reminder on her phone to pay me back by the 2nd or 3rd of each month. Despite this, she still hasnt paid me back for January's bills.

I'm not planning on taking any action until she hasnt paid me for at least a week, but WIBTA if I started hiding common space items in my room until she pays me back without reminding her this month? I own 99% of the stuff in this apartment and I wouldn't take away something huge like the plates or bowls; just small nuisances like the reusable keurig pod or the Brita filter or the blender that she uses every morning. I'm worried that I'm being irrational by not reminding her about the rent or telling her I'm doing this before I actually do it, but I'm also over having to remind her every month even though she's been through this before and has reminders set. 

Any input is appreciated! (also reminder to hug your roommate today if they're an awesome roommate)

EDIT: thanks to the folks with speedy replies! I was definitely thinking emotionally when I first posted this but I really do appreciate y'all who helped me think rationally instead. I'm sending her a text about us talking tonight about the rent, and I'll make a deadline for her to pay me by with actual consequences like eviction if she doesn't pay me by then. As much as my passive aggressive ass wants to be petty, you guys are right. Thank you!!

AITA for calling CPS on my mother because of her mental ill health? | I'm honestly really fucking conflicted on this and idk what to do. This may get long, so TL:DR at the bottom of it does. 

I (22M) have two younger sisters, H and K who are 15 and 10 respectively. They both have me absolutely wrapped around their little fingers and can get me to do anything. When I tell you I love those girls more than I love anything else in the world, I really do mean it. I guess that's mostly because I've acted as a parent to them for most of their lives; their father walked out on our mother shortly before K was born and we haven't seen hide nor hair of him since. Our mum suffers from a rather severe case what I believe to be bipolar, but I can't say for sure because she refuses to get a proper diagnosis or treatment, citing a phobia of doctors as her reason. 

As one can imagine when suffering with something like that and refusing treatment, she historically hasn't been the greatest mother in the world. Don't get me wrong - sometimes she was fine and was ""with it"" enough to take care of us properly. Other times, however, she'd either have these wild manic phases where she'd go on massive spending sprees and blow all our money but forget to pay the bills or buy groceries or go on party benders and vanish for days or even weeks at a time, or she'd have depressive phases where she wouldn't get out of bed for days and we'd kind of have to fend for ourselves. While I was at home, these phases were frequent enough to be frustrating, but it was about a 50/50 balance of her being okay and not. 

After I moved out at 18 for uni, things seemingly started getting steadily worse. It's now reached a point where I have to send H money each week so *she* can do the grocery shopping, and where they're both going to the local leisure centre to shower regularly because mum keeps ""forgetting"" to pay the hot water bill. There's also been several occasions where one of them has called me in tears because mum has come home drunk or high and passed out in a pool of vomit. I've tried repeatedly to talk to mum about getting help, but she just cries and talks about how afraid of doctors she is and refuses to get actual medical help, instead preferring to rely on things like essential oils and such to ""help"". 

Things really came to a head about a month ago, when H called me, absolutely crying her eyes out, because mum hadn't been home in a week and people to whom she owes money keep coming to the house looking for her. I rang everyone I could think of to find out where the fuck she was, eventually locating her as having been at some guys apartment snorting coke an hour away from the house the whole time. I was fucking furious. I live more than two hours away from their place and in a shared apartment without much space or I'd have gone and picked my sisters up in a heart beat. So I did the next best thing I could think of and called CPS on my mother. My sister's have (hit send too soon by accident, editing to complete) been placed in the care of our aunt while I look for a bigger place with space for them to come and stay with me. 

However, I have been getting a barrage of messages from my mother and various other relatives telling me how devastated my mum is, how much she regrets what she did and how she can't help it because she's *so* afraid of doctors. Also getting told I'm an asshole for doing this to my own mother I'm getting so many messages I'm starting to feel guilty. AITA or did I do the right thing?

AITA for calling CPS on my mother because of her mental ill health? | I'm honestly really fucking conflicted on this and idk what to do. This may get long, so TL:DR at the bottom of it does. 

I (22M) have two younger sisters, H and K who are 15 and 10 respectively. They both have me absolutely wrapped around their little fingers and can get me to do anything. When I tell you I love those girls more than I love anything else in the world, I really do mean it. I guess that's mostly because I've acted as a parent to them for most of their lives; their father walked out on our mother shortly before K was born and we haven't seen hide nor hair of him since. Our mum suffers from a rather severe case what I believe to be bipolar, but I can't say for sure because she refuses to get a proper diagnosis or treatment, citing a phobia of doctors as her reason. 

As one can imagine when suffering with something like that and refusing treatment, she historically hasn't been the greatest mother in the world.

AITA for serving meat to my vegan husband to save his life? | I know this sounds bad, but hear me out.

My (33f) husband (35m) was diagnosed with a protein deficiency last year. He was hospitalized for a week and was given meds to counter his condition. Our doctor promised him a full recovery if he listened to his guidelines. Unfortunately, as he was getting better and better, he dropped his meds (he tried “natural therapy”)without telling me and was hospitalized again last month. This time it was more serious and it’s really affecting his quality of life (always tired, depressed,moody). Therefore, I have started to hide meat in his meals such as putting beef in his vegan sandwich and what not. When I told my sister, she completely freaked out and told me that I am a criminal. I think I am justified as he either has to take his meds or eat meat (confirmed by his doctor). So AITA?

Edit: I live in Zambia. Not a lot of demand for vegan options here. Therefore Tofu and other protein shakes is very expensive. Sorry for the confusion.

WIBTA if I posted about my husband going to rehab on Facebook? | I have always, always been an open book.  My friends are scattered literally all over the world because of how much I moved/travelled before I moved to the place where I met my now husband.

My husband was clean when I met him up until a few weeks ago when through his job he got reintroduced to his addiction and relapsed.  He managed to keep himself clean for a couple weeks but has relapsed again and we are taking him straight to rehab.

I am an emotional wreck and would love to reach out to my friends as I always have when dealing with intense things in my life including my own mental health issues.  My friends have always been supportive rocks for me in times of choppy waters.

But this is a little different, it's not just my story.  I know my husband feels intense guilt and shame over what has happened.  It's not a part of his life that he hides (he told me on date 3), but he doesn't broadcast it to the world either.  As much as I want to reach out to my friends and gather their support right now, I can't help but feel like I would be TA for telling everyone on a social media platform.  But I feel exhausted by the idea of calling all my friends individually when I need support, having to explain it each time, go through the same round of questions, before I get to the part where my friend can be supportive.  It makes me not want to talk to anyone about it at all.  That's why I prefer posting on FB, gets everything out of the way, it's all there, everyone knows, and people can make a choice if they are comfortable being supportive to me on this topic.

I do have a therapist.  I don't really have family, so I lean very hard on my friends. 

EDIT: BOLD FOR EMPHASIS CAUSE MANY PEOPLE AREN'T READING TO THE END. **I would restrict the post to be viewable just to my friends, no mutual friends or his family or the public** (though they all know).

Also, by ""open book"", I mean that literally.  I have some issues of my own that might socially be considered ""sensitive"".  My dad has regular chastised me that I won't keep friends/get jobs if I keep posting about my journey with my mental health like I do.  Well, he was wrong on both counts.  I have made no issue ""too sensitive"" to broadcast about and have been regularly told by people that my common conversing of my issues helped them get the strength to reach out for support on their own needs.  My husband knows this about me and married me knowing this.  I'm not looking to shame my husband.  If anyone began trashing him, they would be gone.  (One friend whom I keep because she lives close already is after her behavior when he was missing). 


I know who my husband is: a good man who had a hard life, got into some addictive shit, but got himself out of it.  He had a moment of weakness coupled with opportunity, and the shame spiral is keeping him from staying clean.  Anyone who says differently or passes judgement in him would not be a friend of mine.

Edit 2: A group text or chat is literally no different than a private post.  Everyone on here talks about group texts/chat like it somehow can't have the exact same repercussions as a private post.  It's just heard mentality of ""social media bad"" and stigmatizing issues that shouldn't be stigmatized.  I don't listen to this kind of nonsense about my issues, and I don't believe this kind of nonsense should be listened too.  All the YTAs confirmed what my concern was:

Do I not want to talk about it because I'm worried about me and my husband being judged and shamed by my friends, or because common social norms would have me believe this is something only to be discussed in whispered corners?

Clearly, the later of the two.  Yes, my husband's health and recovery is his own business, but if he was sick in the hospital with cancer, no one would shame me for talking about it publicly.  No one would tell me this is his private issue he is going through and I have no right to discuss it because it's not mine like it doesn't effect me.  

Yes, cancer isn't stigmatized like addiction, so I'm not going to post publicly about the matter.  I am not looking to embarrass him or cost him anything with his friends, family, and work.  But, my husband is sick.  His illness has an effect on me.  I need to work out what my life looks like and what I am going to do.  I need my friends for support right now, and which ones, who, or how is just all frilly details that nobody gets to tell me what is right for me or how I process this so long as I act with intent that it is about how my life is effected, what I need and not what his life is/what he needs to be doing.

Thank you for your judgements.

AITA for letting my dog run around in a dog park | So a bit of background, I walk my dog to this off lead dog park every day, and it has a running track on it, so there are joggers occasionally. Now this wouldn't be a problem other than my dog likes to go and greet other people or dogs before leaving them alone. (He is a Jack Russell Terrier and runs faster than anyone I have met, he is also overly friendly). So today I take him down, and let him off lead, he plays with some dogs and has a good time. Eventually a young woman enters with kids probably about 4 or 5. She leaves them in a long jump sand pit and begins to jog around the track. As she does so my dog and the dog he is with go over to her. She tells the owner of the other dog she doesn't want dogs near her while she jogs. She keeps going, the dogs leave her alone. So after about 5 mins I start to head back to where I entered to go home, but the gate to enter/exit is near this woman's kids. My dog decides to run over to these kids, the kids scream as he approaches them, and the mother comes over, my dog gets scared when they scream and comes back to me. The woman then comes over to me, so I apologize for my dog scaring her kids. She then says I can't let my dog off lead while people are training (her jogging around the track) and how her kids are petrified of dogs. However the signs around the park state you can have your dog off lead unless there is a public training / sporting event. Personally I think she shouldn't leave her kids unattended in a dog park, but at the same time I feel awful for letting my dog scare them, and I feel extremely guilty. Am I the asshole? I need someone else's opinion.

AITA for getting upset about someone driving drunk 7 years ago | TL;DR basically the title but I’ll give a brief transcript of the conversation. 


**Friend:** *(normal cheerful drunk person tone of voice)* I’ve driven while extremely drunk before! Only once though! 


**Me:** *(serious/angry tone of voice)* That’s really fucked up.


**Friend:** I only did it because [acquaintance who has a reputation for driving while blackout drunk] was going to drive home so I had to drive him instead!


**Me:** yeah that doesn’t make it okay, you could’ve called a cab.


**Friend:** Man fuck off, it was seven years ago, are you fucking judging me for something I did almost a decade ago?! People change, you asshole!


*(end conversation, he isn’t on speaking terms with me now)*


So, AITA? I personally feel like I’m not wrong to be disgusted by that behaviour, because I’ve done a lot of drinking, and drugs, etc, and I’ve never even *considered* driving while even *slightly* drunk or high. 


I don’t think “I was young I’m a different person now” or “I was drunk and didn’t make good decisions” are good excuses, because I’ve been a young alcoholic party animal too and I NEVER would’ve considered driving drunk, even  when I was too fucked up to remember my own name I could still remember “don’t drive, someone could die”. 


I have to be brutally honest and say that, deep down, I’m worried that anyone who would choose to drive while hammered just secretly doesn’t give a shit about other people and the fact that they might die. Anyone who would cheerfully bring up, and make excuses for, driving drunk in the past is probably still asshole too, since they obviously don’t feel ashamed of doing it, right? 


On the other hand, my friends who are still talking to me think I’m a completely judgmental asshole. Apparently almost every single one of them was a wild teenager who drove drunk because they’re young and dumb, and it’s something all teenagers on the planet(except me) did at one point, and judging someone for a drunken mistake 7 years ago is a total asshole move (even if it was a mistake that could’ve killed someone) because everyone changes so much from age 21-28 that it’s actually an asshole move to assume that they’re still the same person they were back then.



So reddit, you be the judge. Also, necessary background info: though we do live in a small city with cabs and buses, it is a very redneck area where drunk driving is extremely common, so my friends are probably telling the truth when they say they’ve all driven drunk before... it’s culturally socially acceptable here (unfortunately). So please keep in mind that that probably makes me more of an asshole than I would be in a city where drunk driving is rare and scandalous.

AITA for getting upset about someone driving drunk 7 years ago | TL;DR basically the title but I’ll give a brief transcript of the conversation. 


**Friend:** *(normal cheerful drunk person tone of voice)* I’ve driven while extremely drunk before! Only once though! 


**Me:** *(serious/angry tone of voice)* That’s really fucked up.


**Friend:** I only did it because [acquaintance who has a reputation for driving while blackout drunk] was going to drive home so I had to drive him instead!


**Me:** yeah that doesn’t make it okay, you could’ve called a cab.


**Friend:** Man fuck off, it was seven years ago, are you fucking judging me for something I did almost a decade ago?! People change, you asshole!

AITA because I said “Cancer is a bitch. You and I we are not afraid of no bitch“ | I (34f) was with my friend(36f) the other day drinking wine and talking shit. My friend was telling me how she is afraid of getting breast cancer as she is at the age her mother got diagnosed. 

At some point during this conversation I said “Cancer is a bitch. You and I we are not afraid of no bitch. You  know I beat that bitch once and I’ll do it with you if it ever came to it! We will tag team her ass together!”

Out of nowhere my friends gf comes and tells me that I was insensitive to those who lost their lives to cancer. I told her I wasn’t talking about those people I’m just here giving my friend some reassurance and letting her know that if I could do it she could to. 

She then basically said that I thought I was better then those who didn’t survive it “as clearly you think they were weak cause they couldn’t beat cancer like you did” 

I have never been so confused in my life. Was I an inconsiderate asshole?

Edit- This woman (friends gf) has never had cancer,no one in her family has ever had it nor has she ever lost anyone to it.

AITA for grocery shopping and not letting the lady behind me with 2 things go in front | So I waited too long to deal with my hunger and made it to the grocery store around 6 pm after eating just a few granola bars all day.  Since I was shopping hungry and there were a lot of buy 4 get a cheaper price type thing I had a moderately full shopping cart (90 dollars).  There were only 3 lanes open, 2 at the express checkout (15 or less) which had a decently long line but was moving quick.  Then in my line there were 3 or 4 people in front of me with full shopping carts.  I was waiting there about 5 minutes when a lady joins our line behind me with two things.  She made a big display of going and putting them on the ground kind of in front of me and just kept doing this kind of passive aggressive type dance showing me that she had two things.  I was hungry and had already sat in the line for maybe close to 10 mins so I just put all my stuff on the conveyor and went through the line.  As she got closer she complained loudly to the cashier how long all the lines were.  Behind the lady was also a guy that had one flower.  As I was checking out she offered loudly to the guy behind her that he could go in front of her since he just had one thing and how she always offers people with less stuff to go in front of her.  What am I supposed to do though really?  I'm already in the non-express line, am I supposed to just let everyone go in front of me if they only have one or two things?  I thought if I started doing that then other people with just one thing might show up and then where do I cut it off?  Anyways, the cashier was kind of rolling his eyes and I'm not entirely sure who it was for.  So guys, am I the asshole here or is this a cranky lady that thinks she's more important than other people?

AITA For holding the old owner's dead dog hostage until they take their cat. | We bought a house a couple of months ago and the previous owners left behind their cat. After continuously asking they still haven't taken the cat despite saying each day that they will take it in a couple of days.

Today they sent a message that they want to dig up the remains of their dog from the back yard so they can get it cremated. I told them they are welcome to dig up the dog as soon as they've taken their cat away.

We can't keep the cat due to allergies and we feel bad that this cat is suffering outside in the middle of winter (southern hemisphere)

Am I being insensitive for holding their dead dog hostage?

Edit: just to add, the old owner's are still coming each day to feed the cat on a neighbouring vacation lot. So we would like to avoid taking the cat to a shelter where the cat might be euthanized, particularly as we are still hopeful that the owners will take the cat and give it a home.

AITA for scolding my college daughter (19) for asking family for money? | My daughter is a current college student and does not work as she is a full one college student. Her father and I give her a weekly allowance of $50 - which she can spend however she wants; which, is usually groceries, gas and fast food.

Now, recently her cousin whom I speak to sometimes, told me she asked him fo money a couple of times and that he speaks to her regularly just about college and stuff. I offered to reimburse him and then was angry that she went to him instead of her parents. I then called her and told her to stop begging for money because it makes us her look bad and like a beggar. Also, that if you do it once you get comfortable and continue to do it - and we didn’t raise her like that. She was upset with me and gave blunt one word responses and even tried to explain she only asked because she needed gas money. 

I told her if she needs something she should come to us and if we don’t give it to her, then it’s not that important. I feel that $50 is more than enough and she even talked about getting a job to which we said no. She needs to focus on school and there isn’t much she needs to spend her money on. She has a car, phone, and everything else that we pay for - except gas, but she doesn’t need to drive to her classes because she can walk or take the bus. 
 
However, my daughter believes $50 a week isn’t enough and that she barely fills her car because $40 is about a full tank when she she is running low. She also said that the on campus dinning hall and food places have bad hours ( dinner is 4:30-7, lunch is 11-1:30, breakfast is 7 -10) and that breakfast that early makes her feel sick, she’s in class during lunch and can only make dinner when she doesn’t have her volunteering 3-5:15 pm on tuesdays and Thursday’s. Also, on the weekends “apparently” brunch is 7-10 and dinner is 4:30-7 but everything else like Chic Fila and those places are closed. 

I tell her to save her money if she wants to extra things like go to parties or do any local activities like the zoo, movies, or world of fun.

So am I the asshole for scolding her for asking family members for money?

EDIT:

Apparently I should’ve added somethings. She stays on campus, public transportation is included with tuition. However, the public bus runs in a bad area (the city the campus is around is sketchy.) and she’s small so I don’t want her using it at night. 

Also, she volunteers with this thing called jumpstart where she has to train and volunteer 3-5:30 tuesdays and Thursday’s. But, she also has 4 -5 hour training sessions during the weekends and when she doesn’t have class on Monday’s and Friday’s that just started. I feel that is a lot already.

AITA for being mad my girlfriend took my keys? | My lovely girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn’t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave.

Since then, she hasn’t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA?

Edit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn’t she have asked??

Edit 2: and no she still hasn’t responded to me

Edit: I’m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I’m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn’t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it’s early in my time zone

Final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

AITA for being mad my girlfriend took my keys? | My lovely girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn’t appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave.

Since then, she hasn’t answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA?

Edit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn’t she have asked??

Edit 2: and no she still hasn’t responded to me

Edit: I’m at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I’m projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn’t responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it’s early in my time zone

Final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

AITA for not helping Asian student in class | So I'm a freshman in highschool and our school has a lot of Chinese student who speak very little English they like to keep them in groups so that those classes have secendary teachers. My science class has 7 Chinese kids and they can barely speak english. So I sit right next to one and that means there my lab partner. During our first 2 labs I did the work and showed him the answers but the next lab required 2 people actively doing something. And I had no way to tell him how to help me. The secondary teacher came over and told him to help and put the directions into Google translate and he still wouldn't help. So at this point I'm in danger of getting an 0 on the assignment or wasting my lunch to finish it so I just go join another group. Well next day my teacher threatens to give me a lunch detention if I exclude my lab partner again. She said it was disrespectful to him and I was being inconsiderate.

Edit: for some of them and my partner specifically this will be there 2nd year in America

AITA for not leashing my dogs | I have 2 Shiba Inu mix with a sheltie that I got from a breeder when they were about 8 weeks old. I took their training very seriously because I've had bad experience with untrained dogs my parent had at a young age. They also had several trainers and gotten many certificates and qualifications over the course of the first 2 years of their lives and after that, they have essentially became perfect dogs. 

Around the 2 years mark, I started walking them without a leash. I've never had issues with them bothering people or other dogs because they're anti social and they usually walk by people without even looking at them. They use to run after squirrels at first but eventually I trained them to only do it on command. 

The actual walking itself is no issue. One is trained to walk on my left and the other, on my right and they will walk less than a feet from me when I tell them to come to attention. They walk when I walk, They sit when I stop and all this without any gesture or verbal command. 

For 4 years off the leash. They have had 0 major issues. But like 2-3 times a year, there would be an uptight person screaming at me to put a leash on them. 

Today, sitting on the usual bench at the park with one of my dog sitting next to me enjoying the breeze, and the other one somewhere in the woods hunting squirrels and birds (he's a terrible hunter btw!). Some old lady started telling me to leash them. I usually just nod and ignore them but she was persistent. She has a tiny dog parking furiously at my dog and pulling her towards me like a beast. Her dog was clearly untrained and she has no control over him/her.

I told her ""my dogs are well behave as you can see"" (gesturing toward my dog still sitting next to me, not even alarmed at the barking dog). But she threaten to call the cops. After going back and forth for 2min. I decided to just leave. She continues to follow me with her barking dog saying things like ""I don't see you leashing your dog."" At this point, I guess my dog sees her as a threat and she begin growling and finally let out a bark. This was a rare event as my dog (Shiba's in general) rarely ever bark. She even begin showing teeth. And to make matters worst, seconds after, my other dog came, probably answering to his sister's bark. The park is a huge open field, so you can see him running from the distance and he's bigger than his sister (about 10 pounds heavier, due to being mix) I guess this startled the lady and she eventually turned around and walking away while pulling on her, still barking dog. 

I have heard the age old argument of always leashing your dogs because they're unpredictable. But am I the asshole for believing that, that rule shouldn't apply to extremely well trained and well behaved dogs? Especially ones that are anti social and usually ignore other people/dogs.

Edit: to answer some questions, I don't leash them because they're happier that way. 

My local law does not require dogs with a certificates/badge (to signify they pass a specific training course) to be leashed at designated dog parks which includes the one I always go to daily. 

And also to clarify. My dogs would be on a leash had they keep going up to other dogs or people to sniff them. But my dogs don't do that and the other dogs are usually the one pulling on their owners trying to sniff my dogs as they walk by.

And I can't put enough emphasis on how anti social my dogs are. You can have their favorite treats, but if they don't know you or have me at your side, they will ignore you.

Edit 2: The interaction is indeed at the dog park which is a VERY large open grass field with a river running by it. It has a very nice scenery so a lot of people end up strolling here and it became an unofficial community gathering spot for picnics or even hikes as the park also borders a minature wood area.

One of my dog hunts behind a mostly fenced off area where none of the ""hiking"" trail or people can't get to. Fence is about 4 feet high but he can jump it easily which has almost became a sightseeing event for other daily goers here. As for how I get him to come back when I want to leave, I just shout his name and he'll usually be flying back within 10-20 seconds.

AITA for not leashing my dogs | I have 2 Shiba Inu mix with a sheltie that I got from a breeder when they were about 8 weeks old. I took their training very seriously because I've had bad experience with untrained dogs my parent had at a young age. They also had several trainers and gotten many certificates and qualifications over the course of the first 2 years of their lives and after that, they have essentially became perfect dogs. 

Around the 2 years mark, I started walking them without a leash. I've never had issues with them bothering people or other dogs because they're anti social and they usually walk by people without even looking at them. They use to run after squirrels at first but eventually I trained them to only do it on command. 

The actual walking itself is no issue. One is trained to walk on my left and the other, on my right and they will walk less than a feet from me when I tell them to come to attention. They walk when I walk, They sit when I stop and all this without any gesture or verbal command. 

For 4 years off the leash. They have had 0 major issues. But like 2-3 times a year, there would be an uptight person screaming at me to put a leash on them. 

Today, sitting on the usual bench at the park with one of my dog sitting next to me enjoying the breeze, and the other one somewhere in the woods hunting squirrels and birds (he's a terrible hunter btw!). Some old lady started telling me to leash them. I usually just nod and ignore them but she was persistent. She has a tiny dog parking furiously at my dog and pulling her towards me like a beast. Her dog was clearly untrained and she has no control over him/her.

I told her ""my dogs are well behave as you can see"" (gesturing toward my dog still sitting next to me, not even alarmed at the barking dog). But she threaten to call the cops. After going back and forth for 2min. I decided to just leave. She continues to follow me with her barking dog saying things like ""I don't see you leashing your dog."" At this point, I guess my dog sees her as a threat and she begin growling and finally let out a bark. This was a rare event as my dog (Shiba's in general) rarely ever bark. She even begin showing teeth. And to make matters worst, seconds after, my other dog came, probably answering to his sister's bark. The park is a huge open field, so you can see him running from the distance and he's bigger than his sister (about 10 pounds heavier, due to being mix) I guess this startled the lady and she eventually turned around and walking away while pulling on her, still barking dog. 

I have heard the age old argument of always leashing your dogs because they're unpredictable. But am I the asshole for believing that, that rule shouldn't apply to extremely well trained and well behaved dogs? Especially ones that are anti social and usually ignore other people/dogs.

Edit: to answer some questions, I don't leash them because they're happier that way. 

My local law does not require dogs with a certificates/badge (to signify they pass a specific training course) to be leashed at designated dog parks which includes the one I always go to daily. 

And also to clarify. My dogs would be on a leash had they keep going up to other dogs or people to sniff them. But my dogs don't do that and the other dogs are usually the one pulling on their owners trying to sniff my dogs as they walk by.

And I can't put enough emphasis on how anti social my dogs are. You can have their favorite treats, but if they don't know you or have me at your side, they will ignore you.

Edit 2: The interaction is indeed at the dog park which is a VERY large open grass field with a river running by it. It has a very nice scenery so a lot of people end up strolling here and it became an unofficial community gathering spot for picnics or even hikes as the park also borders a minature wood area.

One of my dog hunts behind a mostly fenced off area where none of the ""hiking"" trail or people can't get to. Fence is about 4 feet high but he can jump it easily which has almost became a sightseeing event for other daily goers here. As for how I get him to come back when I want to leave, I just shout his name and he'll usually be flying back within 10-20 seconds.

AITA for wanting to go to my brothers wedding even though my wife told me not to | So my brother is getting married in two weeks. The wedding is in LA where the rest of my family lives, my wife and I live on the east coast. I’m the best man.

My wife just recently got put in bed rest, and is 8 months pregnant. She said that I can’t go to the wedding. I can’t just skip my brothers wedding. Especially when I’m the best man. The original plan was fly over two days early, stay three days and fly back. 

I’ve moved the flight to night of the day before and afternoon of the day after.

My wife is still saying I can’t go. Her friends are willing to come over and help, and worst come to worst her parents can drive up and stay a day or two. It’s not like she’ll be all alone.

I told her I can’t skip the wedding and that she’ll be fine and there are other people to help her. It’s only a day and a half, nothing’s going to happen.

She said that if I cared about her I would skip the wedding. I got pissed off and said she can think that if she wants but I’m going either way. She’s now only talking to me to demand water.

AITA for smoking weed in my room when it bothers my neighbours? | Background info: I still live at home with my mom, the smell never bothers her because i make sure it doesn't (Towel under the door, fan blowing the smoke away etc.) and as long as that's the case she's fine with me smoking in my room. Also I live in the Netherlands so legality is not a problem.

Recently i've been getting texts from my upstairs neighbours, about their house smelling like weed and this bothering them. They also have a son who is (i think) about 9-10 years old. I do my best to make sure the smell doesn't bother them (Keeping my window closed despite the rather tropical temperatures lately, for example) but sometimes it gets through, i guess. They've asked me why i can't just go outside and smoke, the thing is i really enjoy my moment of coming home from work (physical labor, + 1 hour of commute on my bicycle, so when i get home i'm usually pretty beat), sitting back in my chair, grabbing a drink and having a smoke.

AITA for wanting a new ring? | My husband and I have been together 9 years and married for 3. Sometime after getting engaged and before getting married, we went to the local mall and I picked out a beautiful and affordable ring for us at the time. The issue is not the style or look of the ring, but the materials. Affordable for us at the time meant lower quality metals. To keep the ring nice, it came with instructions not to sleep in it or get it too wet too frequently. The manufacturer of the ring included a warranty that they would replace the ring one time should it get damaged beyond wear. We used that warranty about 1 year after having the ring. 

Nowadays (well, before the current world situation) I'm a preschool teacher. I'm constantly washing my hands and getting sticky, and other not-good-for-the-ring things. Not to mention that I've owned it for years now and worn it regularly. The rose gold tone is wearing off (like it did before replacing) and the metal underneath makes me itchy and turn green. The stones have lost their luster so it looks permanently dirty. All of this means I can't wear it much anymore. 

I found a ring online that was similar in style and made with more quality materials. It is affordable for us (I would be paying for it myself anyway) and I asked my husband about getting it. I told him the issues I have with my current ring being careful not to mention its ""lesser quality"". I tried to explain from a place of ""I'm currently not able to wear my ring frequently and I dont like taking it off"". 

He was less than thrilled. He asked if I wanted to replace all of the jewelry he's gotten for me which is ridiculous. I told him I was looking for an everyday ring and wanted to save the current one for more special occasions. I maybe TA for that because it's not 100% true. If I got this new ring, I dont know that I'd wear my current one anymore. 

I feel like he's blowing this way out of proportion. It's not like I said the original ring was ugly or terrible. I picked it out for fucks sake. I dont think it's crazy to want an upgrade now that we can afford to get one.

AITA for not helping my ex-wife? | Long story short, divorced after 10 yrs of marriage. She was using drugs, endangering our child, and abusive to me. I have the kid, and work full time.

I’m paying TWO damn rents, but have more money now that I’ve ever had. Life is better.

She’s pissed I don’t give her any money (divorce order granted her NO spouse support). I do pay $2400  rent for the last 3 months (house we used to live in, lease expires in June), and give her $100 to pay electric bill. She has no job.

She has no car, it broke down right before the divorce, but I gave her the $3500 the insurance paid out. 

I take my daughter over 3x per week so they can spend time together. 

All she does is complain how I did this to her, she’s nobody anymore, and I took her kid away. She’s not wrong, but she doesn’t understand I didn’t WANT to do those things. I HAD to.

If she put even a little effort into becoming an adult I might feel bad, but this is pathetic.

EDIT: oh, I forgot, found a meth pipe last time we were over. Gonna drug test her tonight.

WIBTA for asking my wife not to take a promotion? | My [30M] wife [28F] just got offered a great promotion to be the manager for her team. Solid bump in pay including a new bonus. Great gig all around. 

My wife is amazing at her current role. She’s knocking it out of the park in everything she does. She is constantly getting praise from all her higher ups on all of her products and presentations. She truly amazing as an individual contirbutor. 

However, this promotion would put her in charge of five other people, and she’s absolutely terrible at making decisions; she has anxiety and crippling guilt, so any time she actually does make a decision, which is insanely rare, she spends the rest of her time dwelling on that decision and how terrible it was and how much trouble she’s cause, etc. It will literally consume days of mental bandwidth. I just can’t see how she would succeed in a role where she not only has to make decisions in general, she has to make decisions for other people. 

She’s also an hopeless people pleaser. She will only tell people what they want to hear, and won’t make any decision or do anything that would possibly upset anyone else in anyway. This makes her very pleasant to be around, which is why everyone loves her, but not a great quality for a manager. 

She technically has accepted the role but hasn’t officially started yet. But she’s already having problems. Her team is leaving for an offsite training in a couple weeks and one team member had a medical problem and could no longer attend, so another person is taking their spot, but there are no longer any hotels available near the event. The employee asked if she could just stay in my wife’s room. Immediately, without thinking because she doesn’t want to ever let anyone down, she said absolutely the employee could. When she told this to me, I said she should probably check with HR to make sure there wasn’t a policy against that or anything, just as a precautionary measure. 

My wife absolutely melted down, full blown panic attack. Most of it wasn’t coherent, but the gist was that by going to HR she would be admitting she did something wrong (she hasn’t done anything yet) and they would fire her and/or telling the employee that she can’t stay in her room would let her down and that would be a fate worse than death. 

I love my wife and support her in every way. Even without this promotion, she makes more than me, and I do most/all of the cooking, cleaning, house maintenance, yard work, car maintenance, etc. So, it works for us. We are more than comfortable with our income where its at, the new money would be great, but isn’t necessary in anyway. I’m just terrified that she’s going to be miserable and bring the attitude with her home, because its going to be filled with things that she hates doing and is profoundly terrible at. 

So, given all that: WIBTA for telling her taking this promotion would be a bad choice.

AITA for telling my gf I want nothing to do with our (potential) kid | So I (26m) don’t like kids, I never have, and was always adamant that I would never have kids.  So much so that when I was 22 I wanted to get a vasectomy.  The doctor told me to wait and think it over since I was so young, but I eventually got one when I was 24.  It went well, and test results at the time showed I had no sperm count. 

My girlfriend of three years also said she never wanted kids (wanting kids would be a dealbreaker for me) and I thought that was it and we’d be child free.  Well a last week she found out she was pregnant and we were both in shock.  Between my vasectomy and her being on birth control (for non-pregnancy related reasons) the odds of her getting pregnant should be astronomically low.  We couldn’t believe she was pregnant, and my gf assured me she didn’t cheat and was willing to take a dna test to prove it (if that’s possible at this stage) and I believe her.  I also went back to the doctor to get a sperm count, and somehow a small amount of sperm were present and there would be a small chance I could get someone pregnant.  

Now I don’t want the kid, and was under the assumption she didn’t either.  She says she assumed she would get an abortion if she was pregnant, but actually being pregnant is different and she’s having second thoughts.  While I strongly want her to get an abortion, I realize that it’s ultimately her choice, but I told her that if she does go through with the pregnancy (and doesn’t adopt it), I want nothing to do with it.  I’d do whatever I legally have to do in terms of child support, but I won’t be involved with raising the kid.  Also our relationship would effectively be over because I don’t want to be with someone who has a kid.  My friends and brother think I’m a complete asshole and that I should suck it up if she chooses to have the kid.  I think I took reasonable, if not extreme precautions to ensure I never had to worry about a kid and that I shouldn’t have to raise a kid I don’t want as long as I fulfill my legal obligations.  So reddit, AITA for not wanting to raise my kid?

Edit: to all the people saying the kid isn’t mine, she offered (unprompted) to take a dna test.  Along with my sperm test results and having no reason to suspect she’d cheat, I fully expect that the child would be mine.

Edit 2: thank you to everyone who has responded.  After further discussion with my gf, she is set on having the baby and is slightly against adoption, but considering it.  She still wants me to be in her life, even if our relationship is over and it’s just as friends.  If she has the baby, I’d treat it the same as I do my friends kids; I’d be friendly towards them but have no interest in raising them, just with the addition of child support. We are planning to get a dna test done as well.

AITA for telling my gf I want nothing to do with our (potential) kid | So I (26m) don’t like kids, I never have, and was always adamant that I would never have kids.  So much so that when I was 22 I wanted to get a vasectomy.  The doctor told me to wait and think it over since I was so young, but I eventually got one when I was 24.  It went well, and test results at the time showed I had no sperm count. 

My girlfriend of three years also said she never wanted kids (wanting kids would be a dealbreaker for me) and I thought that was it and we’d be child free.  Well a last week she found out she was pregnant and we were both in shock.  Between my vasectomy and her being on birth control (for non-pregnancy related reasons) the odds of her getting pregnant should be astronomically low.  We couldn’t believe she was pregnant, and my gf assured me she didn’t cheat and was willing to take a dna test to prove it (if that’s possible at this stage) and I believe her.  I also went back to the doctor to get a sperm count, and somehow a small amount of sperm were present and there would be a small chance I could get someone pregnant.  

Now I don’t want the kid, and was under the assumption she didn’t either.  She says she assumed she would get an abortion if she was pregnant, but actually being pregnant is different and she’s having second thoughts.  While I strongly want her to get an abortion, I realize that it’s ultimately her choice, but I told her that if she does go through with the pregnancy (and doesn’t adopt it), I want nothing to do with it.  I’d do whatever I legally have to do in terms of child support, but I won’t be involved with raising the kid.  Also our relationship would effectively be over because I don’t want to be with someone who has a kid.  My friends and brother think I’m a complete asshole and that I should suck it up if she chooses to have the kid.  I think I took reasonable, if not extreme precautions to ensure I never had to worry about a kid and that I shouldn’t have to raise a kid I don’t want as long as I fulfill my legal obligations.  So reddit, AITA for not wanting to raise my kid?

Edit: to all the people saying the kid isn’t mine, she offered (unprompted) to take a dna test.  Along with my sperm test results and having no reason to suspect she’d cheat, I fully expect that the child would be mine.

Edit 2: thank you to everyone who has responded.  After further discussion with my gf, she is set on having the baby and is slightly against adoption, but considering it.  She still wants me to be in her life, even if our relationship is over and it’s just as friends.  If she has the baby, I’d treat it the same as I do my friends kids; I’d be friendly towards them but have no interest in raising them, just with the addition of child support. We are planning to get a dna test done as well.

AITA for not giving a coworker a ride to work? | I am a 25 year old female who works in a male dominated workplace. The coworker in question is a 37 year old man.

Until last week, he got rides to and from work every day from one of my friends. I don't know the exact arrangement, but I know that he does favors for him in exchange for the rides, such as helping him build a gaming computer. This coworker that needs rides is a compulsive liar, and therefore I'm not totally certain about certain aspects of his life, but he claims the pick-up truck in his driveway is his and he only doesn't drive himself because it's a lot of money for gas.

Here and there, I have filled in for my friend as the ride to work. He is not terribly out of my way, but I do have to drive the opposite way from work to get him. He and I are not friends, I am doing it as a favor to the one who drives him. He is often drunk on Fridays and is prone to hitting on me on the ride home. He doesn't DO anything wrong, but he does say untoward things that make me uncomfortable.

My friend that is his ride to work had a mental health crisis and quit. He is no longer providing transportation for him, obviously. 

The Friday before last, my boss asked me if I could give him a ride to work. I told him I was willing to give him a ride TO work, but not a ride home. I visit my mother on Friday nights after work because we can't see each other during the week due to our opposing schedules, and I visit my boyfriend out of town on the weekends. We are second shift, so I don't get off work until 11:30 at night. That time with my mom is very precious to me. As petty as it sounds, I am not willing to give even 15 minutes of it to this coworker I'm not close with.

I was assured he would find an alternative ride for him for the ride home. Instead, that night he was waiting for me at my car and told me no one else was willing to do it.

On Monday, I blew a tire and was unable to make it to work. That night, he texted me the following, ""I might not make it to work tomorrow because I'm having trouble finding a ride."" I didn't reply, which I realize is rude, but I don't want to be his daily transportation. Some weeks as crazy as it sounds, I literally do not have a penny of extra gas money. The way I felt was, he didn't ask me for a ride. He hinted around it hoping I would offer, and I just don't want to. I would do it out of pity, but I don't want to offer it.

No one at work thinks I'm being reasonable and all think it's going to be my fault if he gets fired.

AITA? Some feedback would be good, should I just suck it up and tell him I can drive him to work?

AITA for answering the question, not the intention? | Low stakes question here, but my husband and I disagree, so I'm curious.

I'm an adjunct professor teaching speech and media courses at a public university.

I give (ridiculously easy) reading quizzes at the beginning of class.

A student emailed to ask if it's okay if she takes her quiz and leaves after because ""something important has come up.""

I responded that she could do whatever she wanted; I do not force students to attend class; I have never tied students to a chair. AITA for this?

What she \*really\* wanted to know is whether she could do this with no consequences, but that's not what she asked.  The answer to the question is ""yes, of course, but it damages our relationship, and I will remember it if you're on a borderline grade at the end of the semester--especially if you make this a habit"".  Frankly, I think that should be obvious.

&#x200B;

ETA: I am not going to penalize her in any way for this.  This is more about at the end of the semester, \*if\* she has developed a pattern of this, and \*if\* she is on the border (i.e., a 79.4, for example), do I bump her up?  Nah.  Would I bump most students?  Yes.  It's also about whether I kindly advise her not to tell professors that she's skipping out on class because ""something important"" came up, which implies that class isn't.  I'm inclined not to.

Again, her grade is not going to suffer for this in any way.  I may be an asshole, but I'm not a \*monster\*.

ETA (after class): I spoke to her briefly before class and told her that my tone may have been a bit snide, but I trust she had her answer.  She said she wasn't feeling well.  I told her if she'd said that in the email, I'd have told her not to come to class at all today (as out of 16+ quizzes, only the top 10 count).  She left post-quiz, less than five minutes after class started.

I'm still stunned that people consider it a penalty to not round up a student's grade if she develops a pattern of showing up for the quiz but leaving for the lectures, but hey, I'm the A.  Standing by that, though.

AITA for answering the question, not the intention? | Low stakes question here, but my husband and I disagree, so I'm curious.

I'm an adjunct professor teaching speech and media courses at a public university.

I give (ridiculously easy) reading quizzes at the beginning of class.

A student emailed to ask if it's okay if she takes her quiz and leaves after because ""something important has come up.""

I responded that she could do whatever she wanted; I do not force students to attend class; I have never tied students to a chair. AITA for this?

What she \*really\* wanted to know is whether she could do this with no consequences, but that's not what she asked.  The answer to the question is ""yes, of course, but it damages our relationship, and I will remember it if you're on a borderline grade at the end of the semester--especially if you make this a habit"".  Frankly, I think that should be obvious.

&#x200B;

ETA: I am not going to penalize her in any way for this.  This is more about at the end of the semester, \*if\* she has developed a pattern of this, and \*if\* she is on the border (i.e., a 79.4, for example), do I bump her up?  Nah.  Would I bump most students?  Yes.  It's also about whether I kindly advise her not to tell professors that she's skipping out on class because ""something important"" came up, which implies that class isn't.  I'm inclined not to.

Again, her grade is not going to suffer for this in any way.  I may be an asshole, but I'm not a \*monster\*.

ETA (after class): I spoke to her briefly before class and told her that my tone may have been a bit snide, but I trust she had her answer.  She said she wasn't feeling well.  I told her if she'd said that in the email, I'd have told her not to come to class at all today (as out of 16+ quizzes, only the top 10 count).  She left post-quiz, less than five minutes after class started.

I'm still stunned that people consider it a penalty to not round up a student's grade if she develops a pattern of showing up for the quiz but leaving for the lectures, but hey, I'm the A.  Standing by that, though.

AITA for being upset that my divorced parents are getting back together? | I’m 20F, my parents are 49M and 50F. I’m an only child and my parents divorced when I was 14. Since I’m their only kid, my parents doted on me a lot and I was very close to both of them. The divorce was pretty amicable at first but it quickly turned very nasty and bitter and I was caught in the middle - essentially both my parents used me to hurt each other and I struggled a lot. I was a very happy and sociable before but the divorce really messed me up badly and was very traumatic for me - I was diagnosed with depression, picked up some destructive habits to cope, and spent some time in a mental health facility. I’m doing much better now but I still struggle.


I visited my dad for Memorial Day weekend (he always does a cookout) and was shocked when I saw my mom there - they rarely are in the same place. Long story short, my parents told me they never really stopped loving each other and were back together. I just left once they told me, I couldn’t believe it. My parents divorce destroyed my life and they acted very cavalier about it. Obviously I love my parents and want to be happy but at the same time - if they never got divorced, then I never would have had to gone through what I did. My mom tried to call me earlier today but I just can’t talk to her now - she’s left me a pretty angry voicemail saying I’m being disrespectful. My cousin (who is also one of my best friends) told me to get over it, in not so many words. I feel like I might be petty but I feel like my parents just don’t acknowledge the gravity of the situation. AITA?

AITA for telling my step brother his relationship doesn’t need to be in our holiday letter | I’ve never used reddit before but my friend told me about this reddit group after telling her about my situation and suggested I post here.

A month ago I got engaged to my girlfriend of 5 years. Im Home for thanksgiving and A few days ago my mom step dad and step brothers were talking about writing the holiday letter that we send out every year. My mom mentioned that obviously my engagement would be included in the letter as well as a picture of my fiancé and I. 

My step brother said “well then we have to add a bit about my gf and I”. My step brother has been “dating”  his gf for 8 years. However, she lives on a whole different continent. She’s real, they’ve met once before when his dad took him and his brothers to the country she lives in for a week. But, they literally only spent a few hours of their trip visiting GF. This was also five years ago. 

When he mentioned his gf should be included in our holiday letter I said something like “relationships usually only get included in the letter if they are serious.” And I mentioned that this is the first time my Fiancé has been included. 

He was very obviously offended by my comment and said “my gf and I are serious. We’ve been dating for almost ten years and just because we aren’t engaged doesn’t mean we aren’t as serious as you and you’re gf. If you’re GF gets included mine should too.”

This is when I got kind of pissed because I said “you’re internet GF you’ve met literally once is no where near the same thing as my relationship.” 

The fight kind of just stopped and things went awkward and quite. My step dad wants me to apologise and wants to have his sons Gf included in the letter as well as a picture they took together when they met. I’m refusing to apologise and still am standing by my thought that including my stepbrothers GF in the letter is ridiculous. My mom agrees with me that it’s stupid but thinks that I should apologise and get let it go. AITA?

Edit: for more context, my step brothers and I don’t along. Never have. 

This is also not the first time a Holiday card issue hasn’t come up. Last year when I graduate college, I wasn’t allowed to include a picture from my graduation because it was insensitive to my step brothers (one dropped/failed out of college twice and doesn’t do anything with his life (no job), one never went to college and doesn’t haves job and the one I had the fight with went to community college for six years graduated with a general studies degree and works at Maccas.

WIBTA if I dramatically reduced my deceased husband’s parents' contact with our kids? | My husband unexpectedly died about 4 years ago. We have 3 kids who are now in elementary school. After my husband’s death, I moved about 2 hours away to my parents’.

My husband’s parents (my in-laws) were also devastated. He was their only child. They pressured me against moving but eventually we compromised by having the kids visit them for major holidays and a couple weeks in the summer. The boys love this because my in-laws host large holiday celebrations and spoil them to hell and back. My in-laws have also insisted on paying for private schools for the boys, which I did not ask for but appreciate because the public schools here are not very good. My in-laws and I do not get along very well but they are great grandparents.

I have since met someone else and become pregnant and engaged. My in-laws have said unkind things about this to other relatives but I understand that they are still grieving my husband’s death. They have expressed minimal interest in my pregnancy and I do not think they will ever love this child as much as they love my other children.

I do not want my future child to feel like a second class citizen in the family. I plan to pull my kids from private school after they finish elementary because I cannot guarantee my in-laws will pay for my future child in 5 years. Going forward, I would like my kids grandparents to visit instead of sending my kids to visit them. I want to celebrate holidays with just my kids and fiance to ensure they are treated equally and to improve our family bond. I would still allow my in-laws to visit as they like, as long as they are equally kind to my future child, but there is no room for them to stay over and the boys’ grandfather's health concerns make visiting us difficult. Imposing these rules will nearly cut them out.

**Edit: I have no intention of cutting contact with my in-laws.** My kids will still be reminded to call them and make them presents, as they always have been. My in-laws are welcome to visit whenever they would like. It is just unlikely my in-laws can visit much.

**Edit:** Since this has come up regularly, my fiance only has a mother who lives with his sibling in another state. She's very excited for the baby but is dependent on his sibling and cannot afford to express her love in the same manner my in-laws can.

**Edit 2:** Thanks everyone. After reading through the comments, I've decided to talk to the grandparents about paying for the youngest child's K-12 education. I did not expect them to pay for any of my kids to go to private school, but I would rather they all go or none go. It is a huge and obvious difference in treatment for kids living in the same home. If they are hesitant, I will move everyone to public school and the grandparents can save their money to help the older 3 with college. The public schools around here are not horrible, just not as good as the private.

I will continue the kids' summer visits and we'll all start going to Thanksgiving as a complete family (previously, only the kids attended). We'll start our own traditions for Christmas and Easter.

WIBTA if I dramatically reduced my deceased husband’s parents' contact with our kids? | My husband unexpectedly died about 4 years ago. We have 3 kids who are now in elementary school. After my husband’s death, I moved about 2 hours away to my parents’.

My husband’s parents (my in-laws) were also devastated. He was their only child. They pressured me against moving but eventually we compromised by having the kids visit them for major holidays and a couple weeks in the summer. The boys love this because my in-laws host large holiday celebrations and spoil them to hell and back. My in-laws have also insisted on paying for private schools for the boys, which I did not ask for but appreciate because the public schools here are not very good. My in-laws and I do not get along very well but they are great grandparents.

I have since met someone else and become pregnant and engaged. My in-laws have said unkind things about this to other relatives but I understand that they are still grieving my husband’s death. They have expressed minimal interest in my pregnancy and I do not think they will ever love this child as much as they love my other children.

I do not want my future child to feel like a second class citizen in the family. I plan to pull my kids from private school after they finish elementary because I cannot guarantee my in-laws will pay for my future child in 5 years. Going forward, I would like my kids grandparents to visit instead of sending my kids to visit them. I want to celebrate holidays with just my kids and fiance to ensure they are treated equally and to improve our family bond. I would still allow my in-laws to visit as they like, as long as they are equally kind to my future child, but there is no room for them to stay over and the boys’ grandfather's health concerns make visiting us difficult. Imposing these rules will nearly cut them out.

**Edit: I have no intention of cutting contact with my in-laws.** My kids will still be reminded to call them and make them presents, as they always have been. My in-laws are welcome to visit whenever they would like. It is just unlikely my in-laws can visit much.

**Edit:** Since this has come up regularly, my fiance only has a mother who lives with his sibling in another state. She's very excited for the baby but is dependent on his sibling and cannot afford to express her love in the same manner my in-laws can.

AITA for Answering the Door for the Pizza Guy in my Boxers | I've answered the door in my underwear a few times before, when I don't have a pair of pants ready, because I would feel rude to keep them waiting. I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. 

I've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?

Edit: Alright, I'm willing to admit defeat. Looks like I'm the asshole, I'll more properly cloth myself in the future.

AITA for vetoing my husband's name choice for our child? | My husband and I were having trouble agreeing on a name for our daughter, so we decided we'd each pick one and then decide which arrangement sounded better to determine which name would be a first name and which would be the middle. It wasn't an in depth conversation so we didn't discuss vetoes or anything. I genuinely didn't think there would be anything he chose that I would hate that much.

He picked the name Aryann (pronounced Ah-ree-ann). I don't know where he got that, but I'm Jewish and having a kid with a name so close to ""aryan"" is not okay with me. I suggested we change the spelling but he won't budge because he thinks it looks pretty. He thinks I'm reading too deep into it and that no one will think twice about the name ""Aryann."" Am I the asshole for wanting to put my foot down about this and ask him to choose another name?

edit- never mind, I showed my husband this thread to get him to change his mind and he started laughing because apparently he was joking. I'd be annoyed, but I'm too relieved that he's just obnoxious and not a complete moron.

AITA for dying my hair against my boyfriend’s wishes? | LATE UPDATE: my hair is purple and i’m looking for my own apartment :)


TLDR at the bottom, and obligatory sorry for formatting because mobile. 

when i (22F) first met my boyfriend (23M) (will call him A) of over 3 years, I had blonde hair (I’m naturally a brunette). About 6 months in, I went back to my natural hair color and A was very vocal about how much he loved it, and how he dislikes blonde hair. I was taken aback at first, but whatever, everyone has a type I guess. Since then, any mention of a haircut or dye has been met with worried looks and “but I like long and brown”.  Easy enough, so I just let it grow out. 

Fast forward to present day: we both just graduated college and live together. I landed an awesome job working with children. In the midst of all the change, I decide I want to put purple highlights in my hair, just the pieces of hair that frame my face. To reach the color I want, I have to bleach the hair and tone it, so I’ve had blonde highlights for the last week. Predictably, A is not pleased.  When he first saw, he was visibly upset and asked why I would do that when I know he hates it.  Since then, he’s made comments everyday about how blonde my hair is, asking why I did it and asking when I will be doing something else to it. This morning, it reached the boiling point when A expressed how he felt it was unfair of me to “do this to him” because, in his words, hair is the only physical quality that is make or break in a relationship. He claims that he doesn’t care if my weight fluctuates, if my skin is broken out, or anything else, but said that out of respect I should dye my hair back, darker this time. He also says that he is finding it hard to be physically attracted to me with this change, because not only is blonde not attractive to him, but that my hair just looks downright bad. 

I feel like that’s fucking ridiculous. I’m an adult and should not have to ask my boyfriend for permission to dye my hair. I can understand him disliking it, but telling me that it’s disrespectful and blaming me for our lack of physical chemistry is asshole-ish.  I feel like if A were to shave his beard or get a buzz cut, I wouldn’t go out of my way to make it about myself. 

Today, I’m heading to the beauty supply store to buy darker hair dye because I feel so humiliated. Reddit, I need your judgements: AITA?

tldr: I dyed my hair a color my boyfriend doesn’t like and he says it’s disrespectful

AITA for getting a pet rabbit? | I've been with Julia (fake name) for 6 years, we've lived together for 4 of them and are expecting our first so things are tense.

I've got two children 7 and 12.

They've been begging for a rabbit for absolute ages.

To explain my garden; we've sectioned it into two parts, the nice part is at the back and the childrens section is at the front where they've got their toys and play area type thing.

Julia has a terrible phobia of everything that bites, she hates birds, rabbits, hamsters, dogs and can barely stand our cat - I don't know where she got the fear from but she's trying to move past it and if she sees a dog outside will interact when possible and used to take my youngest out to feed the birds, still does when she asks so she's attempting to move past it but it's a slow process.

I recently saw a gumtree advert for a rabbit, they wanted it gone that day and I knew it would probably end up as food if I didn't get it.

So, spontaneously I picked it up.

I plan on doing research on the rabbit later.

Julia flipped, calling me an insensitive AH because if she makes me rehome it she'll be the bad guy and on top of that what I've got is ""completely unsustainable"" 

I told her if it came to it we would rehome it's better than the rabbit becoming snake food?

Plus, the rabbit will go in the kids area so she won't have to interact and I'll care for it.

AITA for not wanting my wife to book a hotel by herself for a night away? | Hello Reddit,

&#x200B;

So my wife is pregnant and is in her third trimester. She has recently been complaining about how stressed she is and how she needs a break. She says she needs a night away in a hotel by herself.

&#x200B;

I find the night away in a hotel by herself to be strange, especially seeing that I was talking about taking her away for a ""babymoon"" next weekend where we would both getaway and leave our 2 year old with grandma and grampa. Further, I tell her that I would rather use our vacation fund for joint holidays and not seperate trips and that I don´t want to set a precendent of taking seperate trips like this - I am uncomfortable with the idea. She is furious and says this is not a seperate trip and she needs this, but I tell her that is how I view it.

&#x200B;

After all this I inform her that I would be happy to give her a break this weekend - for both Saturday and Sunday I promise to take care of all responsibility and she is free to do anything but I ask her to come home and at least spend the night with me as there´s no need to get a hotel - especially with our upcoming babymoon. She gets incredibly upset at this and says that nothing will satisfy her except for the hotel and night away.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today (Saturday) and I thought this had blown over. I stick to my offer that I made her previously and start the day off by taking all responsibility around the house and caring for our child while she sleeps, I also make her breakfast. She however blows up at me after all this and says ""No this is not a break. I need a night away in a hotel."" An argument ensues and I end up feeling hurt that she doesn´t appreciate my gesture of giving her the weekend off all responsibility. In the end she storms out and books a hotel for herself anyways and stops talking to me.

&#x200B;

So Reddit, AITA?

I find the night away in a hotel by herself to be strange, especially seeing that I was talking about taking her away for a ""babymoon"" next weekend where we would both getaway and leave our 2 year old with grandma and grampa. Further, I tell her that I would rather use our vacation fund for joint holidays and not seperate trips and that I don´t want to set a precendent of taking seperate trips like this - I am uncomfortable with the idea. She is furious and says this is not a seperate trip and she needs this, but I tell her that is how I view it.

&#x200B;

After all this I inform her that I would be happy to give her a break this weekend - for both Saturday and Sunday I promise to take care of all responsibility and she is free to do anything but I ask her to come home and at least spend the night with me as there´s no need to get a hotel - especially with our upcoming babymoon. She gets incredibly upset at this and says that nothing will satisfy her except for the hotel and night away.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today (Saturday) and I thought this had blown over. I stick to my offer that I made her previously and start the day off by taking all responsibility around the house and caring for our child while she sleeps, I also make her breakfast. She however blows up at me after all this and says ""No this is not a break. I need a night away in a hotel."" An argument ensues and I end up feeling hurt that she doesn´t appreciate my gesture of giving her the weekend off all responsibility. In the end she storms out and books a hotel for herself anyways and stops talking to me.

&#x200B;

So Reddit, AITA?

AITA for not giving my mom her own room? | (I've tried posting this several times and it keeps failing due to the character limit I believe so if anyone has any extra questions ask them and I can go into detail)

The super duper short version of this goes as so:

My mom moved in with me to be closer to family and get back on her feet. She moved into my daughters room since right now we life in a 2BR. I recently got approved for a 3BR house and was supper excited. 

When we went over there today my mom asked which room was hers. I was confused and grumpy from packing all day (by myself with no help) and I snappily asked her what she meant. She changed the conversation. On the car ride home she brought it up again and I said I had assumed she would continue to share a room with my daughter since I had plans for the third bedroom, she didn't have any furniture of her own, this stay was meant to be temporary, and finally because she wasn't even supposed to be staying with me according to my lease. She said since she helps out financially she is entitled to the room and casually threw in that her friend offered to let her stay with him and have her own bedroom, I guess she meant it was a threat? I don't know. I told her we'd figure it out and dropped the subject.

Ever since we've been back home she's been locked up in my daughters room to the point I'm not even able to pack it. She's ignoring me too. AITA?

AITA for telling my young cousin (12) to quit his YouTube channel? | So my cousin recently got an XBOX and started filming his game sessions... with his phone recording the TV screen because he has neither recording stuff nor anything to edit his videos. 

He plays Fortnite and Minecraft mostly and his ""commentary"" consists of him and his family talking over each other and terrible ""jokes"" that only he himself thinks are funny.

He's earnestly trying to become a popular Youtuber like this and thinks if he just uploads hundreds of videos, his subscriber count will grow exponentially as well.

I wanted to spare him the embarrassment of looking back at this years later, along with all the mocking comments he was already getting and told him that maybe he should wait a bit longer before he tries something like this and that he's not going to make it with the stuff he's making right now.

He yelled at me for not supporting his hobby, claimed that I had no idea how Youtube worked, cried and slammed his door in my face. 

I need to know, am I the asshole for trying to talk him out of this?

AITA for telling my young cousin (12) to quit his YouTube channel? | So my cousin recently got an XBOX and started filming his game sessions... with his phone recording the TV screen because he has neither recording stuff nor anything to edit his videos. 

He plays Fortnite and Minecraft mostly and his ""commentary"" consists of him and his family talking over each other and terrible ""jokes"" that only he himself thinks are funny.

He's earnestly trying to become a popular Youtuber like this and thinks if he just uploads hundreds of videos, his subscriber count will grow exponentially as well.

I wanted to spare him the embarrassment of looking back at this years later, along with all the mocking comments he was already getting and told him that maybe he should wait a bit longer before he tries something like this and that he's not going to make it with the stuff he's making right now.

He yelled at me for not supporting his hobby, claimed that I had no idea how Youtube worked, cried and slammed his door in my face. 

I need to know, am I the asshole for trying to talk him out of this?

AITA for asking my friends to delete/remove/block my ex-fiancé from social media? | Throwaway account because some of my friends frequent Reddit, including this sub. 

*For the benefit of you readers it’s worth knowing I don’t have any social media anymore. Facebook went years ago and Instagram was the last to go just before we broke up. 

Okay so: I came out of a huge relationship around Christmas time. I had been with my fiancé for nearly nine years when she finally called time on it 6 months ago. The relationship ended mostly on good terms however it was decided we should no longer keep in touch as it complicates things. 

Obviously with such a long relationship (pretty much my entire 20s) there comes the issue with my friends and family still seeing her life on social media. In particular, Instagram. I didn’t pay much thought to this until my best friend said last week ‘It looks like (insert ex’s name) is doing well, it looks like she finally bought a house’. My heart sank as he also mentioned our two dogs who she now has. I loved those dogs and miss them a lot. 

Anyway, cut to a few nights ago and I’m laid in bed getting angry that my friend (and others before him) we’re giving me unwanted updates on my ex. My conclusion? Start asking everyone to remove her from their social media, including my mum and sisters etc. This is where the trouble started, my friend refused to but said he would maybe cool it on the the updates. My sisters also refused as they said they like seeing the dog updates and such. Petty arguments ensued with no progress or reasoning on how it makes me feel. Another friend said I shouldn’t care and that I’m coming across strange.

I guess my question is AITA? My major fear here is that I’m being controlling of other people’s lives but when it affects me directly I can’t help it. Should I just accept the situation?

Edit: This may not make a huge difference to the outcome of this post but the friends I’m referring to aren’t exactly mutual friends with my ex. They’re my close friends from home who knew and met her when we visited my home city but mostly never knew her that well. Family: fair game. I haven’t asked our real mutual friends to delete her from SM.

AITA for laughing when someone in my work group said she had gotten over a ""fear food""? | I work in a mid-sized office with one of those stupid layouts where you can see everyone, people can chat at tables, etc. Think the ""cool"" tech office. 

Well I was working in a group with a few admins/project managers and the conversation ebbed and flowed. I'm an introvert, but I don't mean that to excuse asocial behavior like some people do. 

One of the admins, a woman, said something like, ""Ohh, I finally got over one of my fear foods this year. It took a lot, but I can eat it in small amounts.""

Another admin said ""That's great! What was it?""

""Peanut butter.""

And here's where I come in. I laughed a little and said ""You were afraid of eating peanut butter? Like what, it would get stuck in your mouth and you wouldn't be able to talk?"" I laughed a little more. A few other people chuckled lightly. 

The first admin looked shocked and embarrassed, and said ""No, that's not what fear food means. Um. Nevermind."" She got up and left from the group, and for the rest of the day she worked alone in the other side of the office.

The second admin was glaring daggers at me and told me I was an asshole and should have kept my mouth shut. I countered it with saying I've never heard of people being \*afraid\* of eating peanut butter. She said that it was part of the admin's eating disorder, and that I should pick up a book, or just stick to not talking in group settings like usual. I thought that was a pretty mean thing to say and came back with ""Maybe she should stick to not talking about her mental health issues in the office if they're so sensitive.""

I'll admin I got a little heated, but I don't feel like it was wrong of me. However she and a few other admins have been nasty towards me. I looked up what fear food was and as a peace offering I brought in a PB Twix for the admin since she said she'd gotten over it. I left it on her desk and she left that day in tears, and now several people won't even talk to me. AITA?

AITA for laughing when someone in my work group said she had gotten over a ""fear food""? | I work in a mid-sized office with one of those stupid layouts where you can see everyone, people can chat at tables, etc. Think the ""cool"" tech office. 

Well I was working in a group with a few admins/project managers and the conversation ebbed and flowed. I'm an introvert, but I don't mean that to excuse asocial behavior like some people do. 

One of the admins, a woman, said something like, ""Ohh, I finally got over one of my fear foods this year. It took a lot, but I can eat it in small amounts.""

Another admin said ""That's great! What was it?""

""Peanut butter.""

And here's where I come in. I laughed a little and said ""You were afraid of eating peanut butter? Like what, it would get stuck in your mouth and you wouldn't be able to talk?"" I laughed a little more. A few other people chuckled lightly. 

The first admin looked shocked and embarrassed, and said ""No, that's not what fear food means. Um. Nevermind."" She got up and left from the group, and for the rest of the day she worked alone in the other side of the office.

The second admin was glaring daggers at me and told me I was an asshole and should have kept my mouth shut. I countered it with saying I've never heard of people being \*afraid\* of eating peanut butter. She said that it was part of the admin's eating disorder, and that I should pick up a book, or just stick to not talking in group settings like usual. I thought that was a pretty mean thing to say and came back with ""Maybe she should stick to not talking about her mental health issues in the office if they're so sensitive.""

AITA for buying my own home though my husband owns his own? | I got married last year after dating Liam for about five years. His wife died about ten years ago, they were married for a very long time and had two kids. Naturally, they bought a house together and raised their kids there. Beth, his former wife and a lovely woman, died after a tragic accident, leaving Liam and their kids. With the boys growing Liam moved into the city I was living in and bought a little apartment but kept his house. He didn't start taking me up to his house until we had been together for about two and a half years. It's preserved in the way it was when Beth was the Queen of the Castle, her photos everywhere, her decorating style, her clothes still in the closets. I don't begrudge this. I think they should keep her things. The boys were young when she died and her death was a huge loss for them. I don't mind her things, although, I won't lie, it does make me feel like a trespasser. I feel like I'm intruding on her space.

&#x200B;

I'm getting close to retirement and I'd like a house somewhere where I can get away from the city to relax. Liam suggested we use his home. I very gently suggested that if we're going to use his house that maybe I could redecorate just a little bit so I feel at home. He shut me down, said it was for the sake of his boys that he leaves the house exactly as it is. Okay, I said, and explained to him why it just wouldn't work for me to live in ""her house"". I tried explaining that I'm not mad or jealous, but don't I have the right to feel comfortable in my own home? So I suggested we buy another house and we would keep his house for the boys. Again, I was shut down. He said he has a perfectly good house and we should use it.

&#x200B;

Once again I explained that if I'm going to live there I need to at least integrate some of myself into it because, as it is right now, I'm uncomfortable. I mean, we don't even sleep in the master bedroom because that was their bed. But again, I understand, but I want somewhere of my own as well.

&#x200B;

So I went and bought my own home in the same town with the intent that Liam and I would share it. It's not a huge house and not very expensive but it's mine. I was up front about it when I bought it but lately he's been kind of pissy about the whole thing and refuses to stay in the house with me. He'll come over but he won't sleep over. So if I want to share a bed with my husband I have to go to ""his house"". Meanwhile, I'm all alone at ""our house"". Hell, even his boys have slept over at my house before, but that was probably for my mean Sunday Pancakes.

&#x200B;

I'm curious, AITA here?

&#x200B;

ETA: a few quick additions. His boys were 12 and 10 when Beth died so they are indeed grown now, and they've taken my side in this situation. I'm still rather young, in my forties, but a very smart business decision has ensure I can afford to retire within a year or two, after which Liam and I would like to have IVF or adopt a child, but I refuse to bring a child into this situation until the housing situation is taken care of. I don't think this is why Liam is refusing to budge though, because he was suggesting we start seeing doctors just last week and has even been suggesting names. I've suggested marriage counseling but he stopped going to therapy after four sessions when Beth died so I doubt I'll be able to get him back in. I'm willing to try everything before I consider divorce. Other than this major issue he's been an amazing partner.

AITA for telling my best friend she has to lose weight? | I created this throwaway just today because I don't want her to find this post. I'll keep it minimalist. 

 I've been friends with this person for over 10 years starting when we were very young, probably 7 or 8. I've always been a bit heavier than my other friends, but that doesn't say much when most of my other friends are dancers and athletes. In fact, we've both always been usually the heavier people in the group until about 2 or 3 years ago when I lost 15 pounds and my BMI became around a 20. She was now the ""odd one out"" when it came to weight. 

 I recently entered a relationship while my friend has been pining for someone for a while. One day, she just straight out asked me, ""Why doesn't anyone like me?"" I explained that it wasn't her, it was them, and that being in a relationship should not define you. I thought it was the end of that. Turns out that instead, she became depressed and gained 25 pounds. She was now obese. I supported her until she got better, but her complaining just continued. 

 Recently, she's been trying to find clothes that she can wear to a party, complaining that everywhere she goes, nothing is in her size. One day, I got fed up and told her, ""Maybe you should try going on a diet or something."" She didn't take this lightly and accused me of calling her fat. I told her, straight, that maybe it wouldn't hurt to lose a few pounds so that she has something to wear, but she didn't listen and has since then ghosted me. 

 Am I in the wrong?

AITA because my brother ate my food? | So for some backstory: My mom cooked dinner for the family the other night and I didn’t eat it right then and there. So the next day I ate about a quarter of my plate and put the rest of it up so I had something to eat after work. So then when I got off work I noticed my plate was missing and I asked her if she’d seen it. She told me she gave the rest to my brother and then hung up on me. So I flipped out on her and told her I saved the rest of it for me after work and told me that I was making a big deal out of it and that I was jealous of my brother then wanted ME to apologize for it. Since then I’ve been giving her the cold shoulder not really speaking to her because I’m not mad that my brother ate my food, it’s the fact that no one told me until after I got off work.



UPDATE: I apologized because I realized I did overreact. Things are good now I guess

AITA for expecting my wife to put her married name on her doctoral certificate, as opposed to her maiden name. | So my wife will be graduating dental school in May and she brought up to me that she would like to practice under our married last name but have her doctoral certificate in her maiden name. Not sure if that's even possible but that's not the concern. I feel as though it's kind of a betrayal to our unity because we have been married the entire time she has been in school minus her freshman year of undergrad and we have both sacrificed alot, surviving primarly on my income (understandably as im older and make significantly more as im already 10 years into my career, and she is in school), countless hours of flipping flash cards, and taking the majority share of housework so she could focus on schooling and her wanting to use her maiden name makes me feel like she isn't recognizing our joint sacrifice and contributions to get us there. I just don't want to walk into her office and people look at the certificate with her maiden name and assume we got married after all that work happened. We did this together and should celebrate it together. 

She feels that since she works full time and goes to school full time, and has paid for the majority of her tuition she feels like she should take pride in her family's name and that I wasnt going to class with her that she deserve that recognition. 

We have a very happy, long marriage and its more of a debate than a fight (actually posting this together) so let us know what you think.

AITA for expecting my ""roommate"" to park on the street | In early fall me and two other people moved into 1/3 of a triplex. One other tenant occupied another plex but the third has been empty since we moved in. In the back, we have 3 private parking spots and technically it is one spot per unit but since nobody has occupied the third unit, it has been me, my roommate and the other guy parking in the 3 spots. One of my roommates friend's who is also my friend recently got kicked out of her living situation. She was in a bind to find a place and we recommended the third unit which she just moved into. Everything has been great except she is now parking in one of the spots causing either me or my roommate to park on the street (which risks getting a ticket, not convenient) AITA if I ask her to park on the street despite it being one parking spot per unit?

AITA for refusing to wash up after easter dinner? | Kind of a petty one here, but it's been the cause of so many stupid arguments.

The story: SO's mother very nicely invited me over for easter dinner knowing I would be spending it alone if she didn't. I am grateful for this.

In her house, the ""rule"" is; person who cooked doesn't have to wash up.

Honestly super fair rule... If her cooking didn't involve using anything and everything to create a meal. One pot meal? She's used three and you'll have no idea why. Making sandwiches? 5 different knifes used, like it truly doesn't make sense.

Anyway, on to dinner, roast chicken, some veg and some potatoes. As soon as I was invited in to the house, without even asking I cracked on with peeling, it's the shittiest job and I want to be helpful. Took me like 10 minutes, honestly, not a big deal.

A couple hours later, dinner is ready. We eat, it's a nice meal. I walk in to the kitchen... I'm not even joking, I wouldn't use this many pots and pans if I were cooking for my entire street. 

""SO's mum, I do really appreciate what you've done but this is... Like how did you manage this? Sorry but this doesn't seem that fair."" 

Her: I've been cooking for two hours, the least you could do is clean up.

""As I said, I do really appreciate this... Wait... Did you just say you've spent two hours cooking? If I made something in my slow cooker, could I claim I cooked for 12 hours?""

Her: no, that would be stupid, you just put it in there and left it.

Expecting the penny to drop here I backed off a little... No penny dropped. She HAS SPENT TWO HOURS COOKING, regardless of the fact I did the most annoying part of it and literally all she did was place items in an oven and then watch TV until it was done... No... She's cooked for two hours. I have to wash up after someone who has no regard for anyone else involved and her justification is completely fine but if I were to use it, it's invalid.

I washed my plate, SO's plate, and the items that could be reasonably be used to create the meal, and left the other like 12 items and left.

Am I the asshole? I'm all for being helpful and I greatly appreciate everything, but I just felt like there was no consideration for anyone else apart from her, and the fact that the justification only applies when she uses it really hit a nerve.

Tell me straight, AITA?

Edit: I can't answer any more questions until I have a better connection, it's becoming quite stressful writing an entire comment and having the page refresh and it disappearing. Hopefully gave enough information in comments.

General idea I've got is: ITA because I knew what would happen and still went through with it, that couples with my shitty attitude, and I'm perfectly happy to accept this. Thank you everyone for helping me see the error in my ways and I'll be communicating with my SO more in the future to hopefully avoid repeats!

Edit 2: /u/Dragonlover18 suggested I post this reply since it explains a bit more
>After discussing with my SO we've come to the conclusion that there were dishes and stuff from previous days that she hadn't done, only other explanation is she threw grease on to random stuff and placed it on the side, which really doesn't seem like something she would do, or anyone...

I'll take being called a petty bitchboy, you wouldn't be wrong, what I did and said was petty as fuck and I acknowledge that fact in literally the first line of the post, but judge me on my actions please, not me as a person.

To the people who said NTA, thank you but I disagree. People have let me see I was the asshole here for my attitude and pettiness and maybe in different circumstances I could believe you guys, but not these ones. Read the comments also please... It's becoming clear people aren't.

Have since called and apologized, if you still haven't scrolled to find out.

If anyone's interested, phonecall consisted of me apologizing for my behavior and an attempt to extend my gratitude as far as I could over the phone. She wanted to make it very clear that she doesn't want to be spoken to how I did, but actually completely understands where I was coming from because ""You are a guest in my home, I expected SO to help you but if someone had asked the same of me(full implication: asking someone to wash up not just that days stuff, but also things that have been there from the past X days too), I'd of probably said the same thing, albeit maybe a little nicer.""

Thanks everyone for judgment though, you guys know as well as me you've saved my ass by kicking me in the right direction.

A couple hours later, dinner is ready. We eat, it's a nice meal. I walk in to the kitchen... I'm not even joking, I wouldn't use this many pots and pans if I were cooking for my entire street. 

""SO's mum, I do really appreciate what you've done but this is... Like how did you manage this? Sorry but this doesn't seem that fair."" 

Her: I've been cooking for two hours, the least you could do is clean up.

""As I said, I do really appreciate this... Wait... Did you just say you've spent two hours cooking? If I made something in my slow cooker, could I claim I cooked for 12 hours?""

Her: no, that would be stupid, you just put it in there and left it.

Expecting the penny to drop here I backed off a little... No penny dropped. She HAS SPENT TWO HOURS COOKING, regardless of the fact I did the most annoying part of it and literally all she did was place items in an oven and then watch TV until it was done... No... She's cooked for two hours. I have to wash up after someone who has no regard for anyone else involved and her justification is completely fine but if I were to use it, it's invalid.

I washed my plate, SO's plate, and the items that could be reasonably be used to create the meal, and left the other like 12 items and left.

Am I the asshole? I'm all for being helpful and I greatly appreciate everything, but I just felt like there was no consideration for anyone else apart from her, and the fact that the justification only applies when she uses it really hit a nerve.

Tell me straight, AITA?

Edit: I can't answer any more questions until I have a better connection, it's becoming quite stressful writing an entire comment and having the page refresh and it disappearing. Hopefully gave enough information in comments.

General idea I've got is: ITA because I knew what would happen and still went through with it, that couples with my shitty attitude, and I'm perfectly happy to accept this. Thank you everyone for helping me see the error in my ways and I'll be communicating with my SO more in the future to hopefully avoid repeats!

Edit 2: /u/Dragonlover18 suggested I post this reply since it explains a bit more
>After discussing with my SO we've come to the conclusion that there were dishes and stuff from previous days that she hadn't done, only other explanation is she threw grease on to random stuff and placed it on the side, which really doesn't seem like something she would do, or anyone...

I'll take being called a petty bitchboy, you wouldn't be wrong, what I did and said was petty as fuck and I acknowledge that fact in literally the first line of the post, but judge me on my actions please, not me as a person.

To the people who said NTA, thank you but I disagree. People have let me see I was the asshole here for my attitude and pettiness and maybe in different circumstances I could believe you guys, but not these ones. Read the comments also please... It's becoming clear people aren't.

Have since called and apologized, if you still haven't scrolled to find out.

If anyone's interested, phonecall consisted of me apologizing for my behavior and an attempt to extend my gratitude as far as I could over the phone. She wanted to make it very clear that she doesn't want to be spoken to how I did, but actually completely understands where I was coming from because ""You are a guest in my home, I expected SO to help you but if someone had asked the same of me(full implication: asking someone to wash up not just that days stuff, but also things that have been there from the past X days too), I'd of probably said the same thing, albeit maybe a little nicer.""

Thanks everyone for judgment though, you guys know as well as me you've saved my ass by kicking me in the right direction.

AITA. Newly Married, car financial disagreement | 
Before our recent marriage my wife had bought new vehicles so often that she is now currently 14k upside down.  ie. purchasing a 20k car means we have to finance 34k.  A few years ago I made the down payment on her current vehicle, Honda Accord (before marriage as a gift) with the mutual understanding/agreement/negotiation that this vehicle would be the one to pay off over time and own outright and eliminate being upside down.

Well this vehicle was recently rear ended and fully repaired.  No mechanical damage, car runs great, repair was excellent.  

She is insisting that we trade in now before the vehicle loses its trade in value due to the reported accident.  I believe this is a non factor as the plan was to own and pay off this vehicle.  It’s trade in after the terms of the loan wouldn’t be outstanding regardless.  

As a result she wants me to pay off her current upside down value (14k) which non of will apply to down payment and purchase a new vehicle using the reasoning that she needs an suv with a hitch to tow our recently purchased kayaks and also to make it down dirt roads.  I believe these are poor reasons to purchase a new vehicle for another 7 years and that I’m only contributing to paying off bad debt and that she may want to do another trade in in the next 2 years.  

Well sufficed to say she’s super angry with me and believes I don’t love her now, threatened divorce etc, as I have opted out to paying for another vehicle that doesn’t get her ahead, just puts her further behind.  

I love my wife and want to provide and help her out of this but I feel like we’ll just have to do this again in 2 years as history and current situation have proven.

WIBTA if I called the police on this creepy guy at our local grocery store | There is this man that rides his bike slowly through the parking lot of our local grocery store and always targets women with children with them for conversation.  The first time it happened, I had my 10 year old daughter with me along with my 3 year old neighbor's son who has long hair and he thought was a girl.  I'm trying to put groceries in the car and he keeps commenting on the kids and trying to talk to them, etc.  He mentioned that he is from some group home in the area and I'm not sure if it's drugs or a mental health issue or what.  Anyway, we go on our way.  So now, it's happened about 5 times if I'm alone or with my daughter.  He rides up, starts asking too many weird questions while I'm trying to put groceries in the car.  I tried ignoring him and he kind of got pissed and said, ""you're a nice person, aren't you??!!""  Now we run to the car and try to avoid him because he gives me the creeps!  My biggest fear is that I will tell the store or call the cops and be made to feel like an asshole.  Maybe he's been in this town forever.  Maybe he's harmless.  I don't know.  Also all this talk about men feeling like weirdos for talking to kids...I don't have a problem with regular men speaking to me or my daughter but he creeps me the fuck out.  Do I call the police or is that being a paranoid asshole?  No man should feel like a predator for normal conversations or behavior with kids, I just have an ugly gut feeling with this guy.

AITA for not paying for my share of the food for a surprise party? | My friend’s son is getting married, and our 8-person mutual friend-group decided to throw her a surprise celebratory dinner in her honor. Originally, the plan was to make the event a potluck. We’re all moms and we have favorite dishes to bring to events, and we’ve known each other long enough to make our potlucks successful. The friend, we’ll call her Amber, hosting the party felt that since we always do a potluck for our get-togethers, we should cater food this time.

This was met with some resistance from the group because that’s not our style. We are pretty low-key people who just wanted to let the new mother-in-law know we’re happy for her. Anyways, so a member of our group offers that we should split the cost of the food. We were sent the menu which seemed simple with appetizers, a couple entrees, and two desserts. We supposed that was fine, and we tentatively agreed.

A week ago, I asked her how things were going with food planning and she said she hadn’t ordered the food yet. The party is tonight, and when talking to her yesterday she said that it cost her $650. Since it’s too close to the party, it’s too late for us to cancel the caterer and just go with a potluck instead. It comes out to $80 a person, which is a lot!! All of us are from different socioeconomic statuses, and I’m about average, but two of the people in the group are in really dire situations, like barely supporting their families, living paycheck to paycheck. It’s not something we like to address because we don’t want to make anyone feel bad for their lack of privilege. I didn’t want them to feel like they were stuck paying this amount because of the social pressure of not seeming well-off.

I decided to take one for the team and expressed my frustration at the outrageous amount of $80 per person when a potluck would have provided a similar amount of food for less than a quarter of the cost per person. I said we should all just contribute as much as we can because it’s not our fault Amber decided to go with such an expensive caterer. I asked Amber why she went with a caterer that was so expensive and she mentioned that she had originally planned on paying all of it anyways. She then took offense to my reaction and said that she doesn’t need me to pay for anything anyhow and that I can “keep my money”. Now, it looks like I’m TA because I can afford it, even if begrudgingly, and I’m the one making a big fuss.  I later messaged her privately and told her I’d pay my full portion, but that it wasn’t fair that she expected us to have a normal reaction especially since we’re pretty aware of each other’s financial state. But now she’s mad at me, is refusing my money, and I don’t even wanna go anymore to this party. I don’t wanna be an even bigger asshole and not eat because I didn’t pay or eat despite not paying. It’s a lose-lose situation. I probably will go though because the party gal has no clue what’s even going on, and I love these friends. Ugh.

So, AITA?

Update: I went to the party, and she ordered food for like 30/40 people. I am not even exaggerating. There was an ENTIRE TABLE of just dessert (like 12 options). We didn’t end up eating more than a fourth of the food, and even after taking some food home, there was still so much left over. She just didn’t stick to the menu at all, adding in a million additional options. I talked to Amber and we decided to be normal for the sake of our guest, and promised to do a phone call sometime next week to clear the air.

AITA for not paying for my share of the food for a surprise party? | My friend’s son is getting married, and our 8-person mutual friend-group decided to throw her a surprise celebratory dinner in her honor. Originally, the plan was to make the event a potluck. We’re all moms and we have favorite dishes to bring to events, and we’ve known each other long enough to make our potlucks successful. The friend, we’ll call her Amber, hosting the party felt that since we always do a potluck for our get-togethers, we should cater food this time.

This was met with some resistance from the group because that’s not our style. We are pretty low-key people who just wanted to let the new mother-in-law know we’re happy for her. Anyways, so a member of our group offers that we should split the cost of the food. We were sent the menu which seemed simple with appetizers, a couple entrees, and two desserts. We supposed that was fine, and we tentatively agreed.

A week ago, I asked her how things were going with food planning and she said she hadn’t ordered the food yet. The party is tonight, and when talking to her yesterday she said that it cost her $650. Since it’s too close to the party, it’s too late for us to cancel the caterer and just go with a potluck instead. It comes out to $80 a person, which is a lot!! All of us are from different socioeconomic statuses, and I’m about average, but two of the people in the group are in really dire situations, like barely supporting their families, living paycheck to paycheck. It’s not something we like to address because we don’t want to make anyone feel bad for their lack of privilege. I didn’t want them to feel like they were stuck paying this amount because of the social pressure of not seeming well-off.

I decided to take one for the team and expressed my frustration at the outrageous amount of $80 per person when a potluck would have provided a similar amount of food for less than a quarter of the cost per person. I said we should all just contribute as much as we can because it’s not our fault Amber decided to go with such an expensive caterer. I asked Amber why she went with a caterer that was so expensive and she mentioned that she had originally planned on paying all of it anyways. She then took offense to my reaction and said that she doesn’t need me to pay for anything anyhow and that I can “keep my money”.

AITA for not wanting to be a former manager's friend? | So, years ago I use to work for a big name company.

He always had this smile on his face and he had a way of making everyone around him feel super uncomfortable. I never liked him. I still don't. Every time I see him, my gut drops and I go into a panic attack, and usually have to go somewhere and cry for 5 minutes because his presence just makes me feel so... dirty. There was one night I wasn't feeling great (I was on the brink of vomiting, I just couldn't find the energy to move without my stomach turning) and I told him I was going to try and get my main area knocked out before I went home (IF I went home), and my area had A LOT. I had several pallets and carts to do, and, after eating something, I felt a bit better but was too swamped to do much else (like doing my before-throwing-large-amounts-of-freight product facing that he ""needed"" me to do before my main area). Night comes to an end and he asks me why I didn't get 5 areas of product faced, told him I got caught up in RUNNING FREIGHT that I forgot about it and set my priorities ahead of time, and he said that everything was all good and to just try and get some product faced before I clocked out.

Fast forward the next night, he calls me out in the meeting. In front of all my peers. Tells me he's not doing my job for me again and I'm expected to get those areas faced before moving on to run freight, even on nights where we get 2 to 3 trucks in. I had confronted him about his behavior privately, and he just berated me and then tried to play victim. Our store manager had me write up a statement/report on him and the incident. And he started being more tolerable. But I still didn't trust him as far as I could throw him.

Fast forward to just a few weeks ago. He comes into my new place of work and starts demanding why I reported him for harassment. I told him I didn't. I had never reported him to anyone for harassment, because, like I said, he became tolerable after getting chewed out because our store manager actually liked me as an employee. He kept going on and on about how I should just admit that I did it, he doesn't give a shit. He finally listened to me and then asked why I didn't like him. I told him ""It's not that I hate you, I just don't think we were ever meant to get along, and that's how some people are, and that's fine."" And he told me that that's unfair of me to think, because it already puts him at a disadvantage. He starts trying to make me feel like shit for not wanting to be his friend, but I have no interest in being his friend, not after he humiliated me in front of my peers and storms into my new place of employment to demand why I reported him/hate him.

He says that I'm being unfair and judging him based upon my own gut feelings and that I was projecting a stereotype on him, and I needed to give him a fair chance, because he wasn't ""like that"".

AITA for not wanting to go to SIL's destination wedding, even when we can afford it? | Not sure if anyone cares, but for those that missed it: I posted earlier about my SIL’s $5,000 destination wedding. We hinted that we might not be able to go and she sort of freaked out.

&#x200B;

Anyways, SIL calls and asks if she’d be able to come over. She is cleaning her closet out and has a bunch of old clothes to give me. I tell husband and he is completely shocked. He said that she has never given anyone her old clothes before.

&#x200B;

She comes over with two full sized garbage bags full of clothes, and we start going through them. They are all designer clothes in mint condition. I’m modelling them for her, and she is hyping me up, telling me how beautiful I am. I’ve never really been accepted by my husband’s family, so this whole thing really meant a lot to me.

&#x200B;

And then she gets to the bottom of the clothes, and pulls out this absolutely stunning dress. She tells me that she wants me to wear the dress to her wedding. And that it has such strong sentimental value to her, and that she’d never give it to anyone else except for me.

&#x200B;

I told her that I loved the dress, but we still weren't sure if we'd be able to make it due to cost. She was very upset, and told us that after all she had done for us, she at least expected us to be there for her.

&#x200B;

After, my husband told me he felt guilty for missing her wedding after she had been so nice to us. Along with the clothes she gave me, she has also given us her old car, and other misc. stuff.

&#x200B;

We decided to sit down and crunched the numbers again since I just got a raise at work. If we put a little bit aside each month, and pull some money from our saving, we should be able to afford it.

&#x200B;

I’m still nervous though. If we have any unexpected expenses, we’d be in trouble. And let’s be honest, if something goes wrong it’s going to be when we are broke.

&#x200B;

So, AITA for still not wanting to go to the wedding after everything she's done for us? I feel like a total piece of garbage.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you everyone for your comments. 

A few people suggested that I sell some of the clothes. I think that's a great idea! 

I spent the night sorting through, and came up with a pile of things to sell. I did some research and if I sell everything for half of its retail value, I can make over $2,000. 

SIL is moving to a city 8 hours away, so she won't notice if I sell some of the clothes. 

Thanks to you guys, it looks like we will be able to go after all ❤

AITA for not giving my father another chance? | Some context first.  My father has never really been in my life since my parents divorced when I was 5.  And even before that,  he was nice only when he wanted to be.  None of his children asides those living with him take anything to do with him.  He is an alcoholic,  addicted to drugs and was violent towards my mother when they were together. 

There were also some other aligations I can't say as they weren't proven,  and neither me or my sisters were old enough to remember anyway.  

After my parents split,  my father stayed in the house forcing my mother into emergency housing with us.  My mother would pay him to be in our lives be it taking care of us for a weekend or taking us out somewhere.  And when he took care of himself he would leave me as a 5-7 year old in charge of my 2 younger sisters.  Sometimes he would leave us with a babysitter while he went to the pub,  and we were frequently left around family for a few hours here and there or just left in the house with a friend we wouldn't know to watch over us. 

He would make empty promises and never follow through,  he would yell at me for things he was told off for when taking care of us and it was overall not a nice environment.  He has never payed a penny towards us unless made to by his partner for Christmas gifts.  

When I was 8 my mother blocked contact with him due to a court ruling he cannot be left alone with us while we are under 16 until he has gone through family therapy with us. 

Since I was 8 he has made little effort to be in our lives and the only times have been when encouraged to by his partner,  which he never went the legal route. 

He doesn't send birthday cards and does Christmas if he remembers,  of which he sends presents that his partner has bought to my uncle who gives them to us.  Any birthday cards he have had someone else has bought and he just signed it. 

Now onto why I think I'm an asshole.  

Due to my Nana's recent death he has came briefly back into my life and told me that he wants to be given another chance to reconnect with me once I turn 16 with is next month as the court ruling is no longer in effect.  However I know he is only doing this to please his wife.  So reddit,  am I the asshole for deciding that for now I don't want him in my life and doubt I ever will?

AITA if I don't celebrate Christmas with my family because we're not doing presents. | OK so here's the problem. My husband is a cop, he has to work all week during Christmas (24 till 30). If I have to go to my family (25th) I have to take the bus, subway and train and then a 10 minute walk to get to my aunt where we celebrate (2 hours travel al least) . Or we have to rent a car just for a day.

We have a daughter, she's 7. The only child in my family. My family decided not to do presents this year, I don't care if I get presents but apparently it's too much for them to at least have presents for my daughter. I said that if there are no presents for my daughter I don't want to go through the hassle of going there, now my mother is mad. (my family is upper class nobody has any money problems)

And we have a big But here, my in laws didn't even bother inviting us for Christmas 'because we never host it at our place'. My husband always has to work a least one of the days and to host a Christmas party on my own while also having a kid around and having to go to my own family is a bit much. (my MIL doesn't work and my SIL and her husband both have vacation the last 2 weeks of the year) 

So at this rate we're not even celebrating Christmas. And now I feel like a bad mother but I also feel like we're just considered second choice family. 

TL:DR: my family doesn't want to buy presents even if it's just for my daughter, and I don't want to bother traveling for 2 hours.

Edit: great that apparently a lot of people have a great relationship with their families, but most of mine haven't bothered coming to mine or my daughter birthdays for the past 2 years.

Edit 2: my husband agrees with me. And let's face it he's the only one that matters. My family isn't fun and nice enough to drag a kid to an adult party. He's going to work overtime the next few weeks so we can get more presents, and he's going to have a word with his SIL for not inviting us, and I'm going to stop babysitting my SIL baby.
The reason why we have not enough money for more present is because the family decided not to do presents 2 weeks ago, we figured that would've only been for the adults so we already bought a nintendo switch while it was on discount. We used the other money we'd normally spend on Christmas to pay of some loans.

AITA for wanting to wear jeans to my own wedding? | Groom here. My fiancee and I are getting married in about a year. She's already started shopping for her wedding dress and asked me to start taking a look at suits. Honestly, though, I'm really not much of a suit and tie kind of guy, and I dress extremely casually in my day-to-day life. Obviously, I'm going to make a point to look sharper than usual for the wedding. I'm planning to wear my favorite pair of jeans with a blazer and a decent button-up shirt, which should be comfortable while still looking nice.

My fiancee got really upset when I said I wasn't going to wear a suit. She thinks jeans are way too casual for a wedding and says I'm going to look ridiculous and underdressed. But I don't think that's true. It's not like I'm showing up in overalls and no shirt or something dumb like that, and I was a groomsman in a wedding just last year where all the guys wore jeans and suspenders.

I would never in a million years tell my fiancee what to wear to our wedding, because that would be insanely controlling, so I don't think she should get a say in what I wear. AITA?

Edit: The wedding is in the woods at a forest preserve, if that makes a difference.

AITA for charging my friend $25 a night for couch surfing? | Throwaway acc. I live in NYC and staying in town for the winter holiday. I have a college friend who I haven’t seen in a number of years and wants to visit for a week until New Year’s to watch the ball drop. She told me she will splurge one night in Times Square on Dec 31 and will be on a tight budget for the rest of the 6 days. As such, she asked me if she could couch surf in my apartment for the other 6 days. 

I have roommates and the only way they will allow her to stay for that amount of time is if she contributes to the added utilities she will be using in 6 days. The amount we all agreed to was $25 a night. She did not take it very well to say the least. She said she was just “couch surfing” and she won’t have any privacy anyway so she wasn’t expecting to pay anything. Plus, from where I'm from, you let people stay in your place out of ""sheer goodwill"" so paying is a foreign concept.

Normally my roommates and I don’t charge guests if they’re staying for a weekend, but 6 days in winter is different. We don’t have centralized heating so she will be using the living room a/c heater separately for the entire night plus all the gadgets she’ll be plugging in. We already see an uptake in utilities 1.5x during winter (this is without using the living room a/c) and her staying will overkill our budget. We thought $150 for 6 nights is reasonable considering a decent hotel during winter wouldn’t be less than $200 a night. 

AITA for charging? Or maybe $25 is a lot?

AITA for telling my stepdaughter that I would prefer if she did not call me dad? | I recently married a woman (like we married a few months ago) with a 10 year old daughter Kate. We dated for about 6 years and lived together for 2 so I could see why Kate would come to see me as father like figure especially since her bio dad passed away while my wife was pregnant.

Okay so yesterday Kate missed the bus and while I was driving her to school , Kate asked me out of the blue if it would make me uncomfortable if she started calling me Dad. I was taken aback and after thinking for about 10 seconds, I told her that I care about her a lot, I would prefer if she just kept on calling me by first name. She said ok in a defeated manner but seemed to take it well.

I was wrong about that. Evidently when she got to school she  uncontrollably cried to the point where my wife had to pick me her up. She was really upset and wouldn't speak to me in the evening.  My wife partially understood my understood as we agreed when we got married that I wouldn't be Kate's dad. But she said I was too harsh and implied that she wanted me to reconsider.

I feel really bad but I don't what I can conceivably do for her that would be good for me too. AITA?

Edit:  People are asking why I don't want to be called Dad. I don't want to be called Dad because I was friends with her actual Dad and her calling me that would remind me of him.

WIBTA for refusing to be my dad's best man in his second marriage? | So I'll try to keep things short here. My dad divorced my mom two years ago. Half a year later, he had a new girlfriend. Things moved pretty fast between them, and right now, they're five months away from completing the renovations of their new home. Last week, he asked me (22) and both of my brothers (20 and 18) to be his best men. Now my youngest brother lived at home during the worst period after the divorce and he lost his faith in my dad, so he immediatly declined. My other brother is more relaxed, so he gave it some thought, and also declined, because we barely know his new girlfriend.  (We actually don't, we have only seen her for three times)

So I'm the last one of three of us. My dad doesn't have many friends, and none of them are close enough to function as his best man. He also doesn't
 have a brother he can ask. So if I don't, he probably would ask someone that isn't even a real friend or relative, and if he did, it would probably be someone that's close to my mom, which would also be a bummer for her. WIBTA for declining his offer, even though it would he doesn't have a proper best man?

AITAH For Wanting My Neighbor's Dogs Put Down | So every since I've moved to Texas, my neighbor has never really talked to us or even acknowledged us. She has 2 big dogs that she keeps in her fenced house. However, she does a shit job at keeping it locked. The dogs get out often, resulting with them going onto my property and shiting in my back yard. One of them bit my dad in the leg before, but he simply gave a warning to my stupid neighbor.
Unfortunately, what we anticipated occured unexpectedly.
My 2 small dogs were in my backyard, and one of them went to my front yard to sunbathe. My dad was washing dishes and watching her through the window. What he didn't see were the two dogs who had bad intentions.
They both began to attack my dog, partly skinning her back and digging into her organs. My dad kicks the front door open and tells them to scram but they had her in their mouths. She was yelping in pain. He went inside for the gun but at that point my other neighbor got the dogs inside and locked their gate.
We immediately took her to the vet and she stayed overnight.
My poor dog unfortunately died on Saturday due to internal damage. My neighbor just shrugged and didn't make an effort to at least lock her gate.
We talked to animal control and they can't do anything unless we have evidence her dogs were out. He did say however, that if we feel endangered for our family (including my baby siblings and dog), that we should do whatever we can to defend ourselves, including shooting the dog(s).
 Both dogs pooped on the same spot they killed my dog, possibly as a taunt to my other dog. They have tried hurting her too. She is all we have and I cannot lose my other dog.
AITAH for my family wanting to take actions into our own hands?

WIBTA if I tell my friends not to order non vegetarian food at my birthday dinner? | So my birthday is coming up and some of my friends like eating non vegetarian food. I don't eat meat since it's against my beliefs and I am not comfortable with people eating meat being next to me that I am paying for. Would I be the a-hole if I ask them not to order non vegetarian food? Also, there are a ton of vegetarian options at the restaurant.


I fucked up in the title. I wanted to ask them, not order them to order vegetarian food. Also, I live in India.

Thank you guys for your input. I think the best thing to do is to take the party to a vegetarian restaurant. Thanks for the help guys.

AITA for asking my 5 year old daughter to lend me $ for gas? | My wife and I trying to use cash only as much as possible to keep us on a budget. The other day I had to leave for work and had no cash for gas. My 5 year old daughter has a piggy bank with money she’s gotten for birthday gifts and things like that. I’m guilty in the past of borrowing from her without asking, and she has noticed before I’ve been able to put the money back, so I stopped doing that. However, she has gotten very possessive of her money, which I don’t think is good.   


This time I asked her if I could borrow money for gas. She clearly didn’t want to, but I explained that families help each other out and I would pay her back. She pulled out a $10 bill and told me she would give me half. Before I could stop her, she ripped it in half. I explained that is not how bills work, but that I could tape it together and use the whole thing. She finally gave me the other half. I already have paid her back, but she was upset and my wife thinks I just should have used our debit card for gas and not asked our daughter at all. I think it’s important for our daughter to learn to share and how money works. AITA?

AITA if I take my money back from the ex wife? | My husband recently passed away and before he did he made my life a living hell. He was abusive and ran us financially into the ground, I’m looking at filing bankruptcy to get out from under this debt he put us in. 

A few years ago he was behind in child support to his first wife and the IRS took our entire refund for 3 years to pay it. I’ve since learned that I can file paper work so that they would have only taken his share of the tax return, not mine.

I could really use the money and apparently I can still file and have that money returned to me. But that means taking it from his ex wife’s tax return(s)

The children are all adults, the youngest has been living on her own for a couple years now. 

The amount I would get back would pay off my car and put me in a bit better financial situation. 

Would I be the asshole for filing the paper work and getting my share back?

Edit to add: I have no contact with the ex wife. After months of continual harassment from her after his death I finally had to block her from contacting me.

AITA for refusing to eat the food that my girlfriend's parents made for me? | I have zero tolerance for spicy food.  The example I always give to people to put this into perspective is if you've ever had the tofu from Chipotle (they call it ""sofritas""), then you have a good idea of the upper limit of what I can handle.  In other words, the tofu from Chipotle is uncomfortably spicy for me, but I can just force it down.  Anything spicier than that is an absolute no go for me.  When I was a teenager, my family was eating at a Mexican restaurant, and I ordered food that ended up being way spicier than I anticipated.  I tried making myself eat it, only to eventually have to leave the restaurant and compose myself in the parking lot because I was having chest pain.  Ever since then, I've promised myself that I would never eat food that is too spicy for me again.  If I buy food that ends up being unexpectedly spicy, then I just throw it away and eat the cost (pun intended).

I'm in my late 20s now and have never had an issue with this approach.  This past Saturday my girlfriend's parents invited us over for dinner.  We've been dating for about six months now, and this was my first time meeting them.  When we arrived, they had prepared this complicated noodle dish with red sauce and chicken (not sure what it was called, but they're Korean if that helps).  I took one bite and immediately realized that I couldn't eat it.  I said, ""I appreciate the amount of effort that you guys have clearly put into this meal, but unfortunately it's just too spicy for me.  I can't eat it, but I'm more than happy to sit here and have a conversation while everyone else eats and then just get McDonald's on the way home.""

Things got a little awkward after that, and once the evening finally wrapped up and my girlfriend and I got in the car to drive home, she said that she was upset with me for ""insulting"" her parents by not eating the food that they spent four hours preparing specifically for me.  I reiterated that it was too spicy for me and that I refused to force myself to eat food that causes me literal physical pain.  She said that it wasn't even that spicy and called me a baby, to which I replied that everyone has difference tolerances for this sort of thing and that not only can I not help it but that it's also never going to change.  She was so aggravated that I didn't even get my McDonald's and had to eat a peanut butter and jelly after we got home.

It's been several days, and she's still upset about this, but I maintain that I did nothing wrong and would handle the situation the same way if it came up again in the future.  Am I somehow in the wrong here?

When I was a teenager, my family was eating at a Mexican restaurant, and I ordered food that ended up being way spicier than I anticipated.  I tried making myself eat it, only to eventually have to leave the restaurant and compose myself in the parking lot because I was having chest pain.  Ever since then, I've promised myself that I would never eat food that is too spicy for me again.  If I buy food that ends up being unexpectedly spicy, then I just throw it away and eat the cost (pun intended).

I'm in my late 20s now and have never had an issue with this approach.  This past Saturday my girlfriend's parents invited us over for dinner.  We've been dating for about six months now, and this was my first time meeting them.  When we arrived, they had prepared this complicated noodle dish with red sauce and chicken (not sure what it was called, but they're Korean if that helps).  I took one bite and immediately realized that I couldn't eat it.  I said, ""I appreciate the amount of effort that you guys have clearly put into this meal, but unfortunately it's just too spicy for me.  I can't eat it, but I'm more than happy to sit here and have a conversation while everyone else eats and then just get McDonald's on the way home.""

Things got a little awkward after that, and once the evening finally wrapped up and my girlfriend and I got in the car to drive home, she said that she was upset with me for ""insulting"" her parents by not eating the food that they spent four hours preparing specifically for me.  I reiterated that it was too spicy for me and that I refused to force myself to eat food that causes me literal physical pain.  She said that it wasn't even that spicy and called me a baby, to which I replied that everyone has difference tolerances for this sort of thing and that not only can I not help it but that it's also never going to change.  She was so aggravated that I didn't even get my McDonald's and had to eat a peanut butter and jelly after we got home.

It's been several days, and she's still upset about this, but I maintain that I did nothing wrong and would handle the situation the same way if it came up again in the future.  Am I somehow in the wrong here?

AITA Celebrated a not guilty verdict. | Last year I was charged with an OUI after declining a breathalyzer test. Earlier this month I was found not guilty due to no breathalyzer or bloodwork being done. My friends decided to throw me a party at our local dive bar, complete with a large Not Guilty banner and a poster of my face photoshopped over O.J. Simpson trying on the glove. A random lady at the bar called us all assholes and two of my friends said I only beat the case because I paid for a very expensive lawyer. All the other 30+ people were very happy for me. So AITA?

Edit for INFO: I was drinking but the reason I got pulled over was my headlights not being turned on. They're usually set to auto but a friends used my car earlier in the night and changed it.

Edit 2: I wasn't aware there was going to be a party, my friends just told me to come out and celebrate. Though the poster was hilarious.

Edit 3: Apparently it's still too soon for OJ jokes lmao, stop being so uptight.

AITA for posting on my girlfriend snapchat story using her account? | She's posted on my insta before (I don't use snapchat).

I took her on vacation to Italy for her birthday a few days ago. I'm paying for everything - flights, travel, activities, food, etc. This is not a cheap vacation, I'm probably spending $12K between the two of us. 

She just got back from a very popular bakery and bought cannolis. They had five flavors, and she bought one of each. And they cost an unbelievably 5 euros each, which is like $28. So overall, I spent more than $30 on cannoli after you account for currency exchange fees etc.

So, I took a video of her eating one and posted it on her snap story with the caption ""just spent $30 of Jake's money on cannoli lol"".

&#x200B;

Now she's all pissed off at me. Did I cross the line?

Offered her a place to stay, I told her she could just stay with me.

Great, I help her move her stuff in and she brings her pet which I’m cool with. 

She comes here.. and wants her own room. I thought she was kidding at first but I did give her a room and helped her setup all her stuff. 

I’m thinking her like wtf, I didn’t sign up for a roommate. She’s in a tough spot so I’m not charging her rent either. 

We’ve been seeing each other it’s not like I’m friend zoned or anything. 

I’m not going to lie, I’ve been thinking about ending the arrangement even though it’s been a few days only. It doesn’t seem to bother her. AITA if it bothers me?

AITA for not making my sister gluten free desserts? | Okay so the title sounds a little selfish but hear me out here

Im (16M) pretty much the baker of the house, my mom will occasionally, but only when I’m busy or not home. When I want to bake, or when my family is dropping hints they want something sweet, I ask my family what they want. Sometimes they give me something specific like cheesecake or cookies, sometimes they just let me have the creative freedom to make what I’m craving. 

Now my sister (20F) doesn’t live with us but she does spend a lot of time at the house, she also happens to have a gluten intolerance and has tried to cut down on gluten. In turn she’s asked me to make gluten free desserts instead of the ones with gluten in them. 

Here’s where the problem comes in, I don’t like the texture that the gluten free flours give the desserts, especially in things such as cakes. When it’s something made specifically for her, such as something specific she requests or something for her birthday, I’ll happily make it. When it’s something I want or someone else in my family wants I make it with normal flour. 

My sister doesn’t like this because she can’t eat them, however whenever I ask her to make a request she only ever says something gluten free. I’m also hesitant to make her gluten free desserts freely because she doesn’t generally eat a lot of dessert because she is trying to watch her weight. And I don’t want the dessert to go waste. 

So Reddit AITA for not making gluten free desserts all the time?

Edit: I changed the wording to reflect that she isn’t diagnosed with celiac

AITA for not making my sister gluten free desserts? | Okay so the title sounds a little selfish but hear me out here

Im (16M) pretty much the baker of the house, my mom will occasionally, but only when I’m busy or not home. When I want to bake, or when my family is dropping hints they want something sweet, I ask my family what they want. Sometimes they give me something specific like cheesecake or cookies, sometimes they just let me have the creative freedom to make what I’m craving. 

Now my sister (20F) doesn’t live with us but she does spend a lot of time at the house, she also happens to have a gluten intolerance and has tried to cut down on gluten. In turn she’s asked me to make gluten free desserts instead of the ones with gluten in them. 

Here’s where the problem comes in, I don’t like the texture that the gluten free flours give the desserts, especially in things such as cakes. When it’s something made specifically for her, such as something specific she requests or something for her birthday, I’ll happily make it. When it’s something I want or someone else in my family wants I make it with normal flour. 

My sister doesn’t like this because she can’t eat them, however whenever I ask her to make a request she only ever says something gluten free. I’m also hesitant to make her gluten free desserts freely because she doesn’t generally eat a lot of dessert because she is trying to watch her weight. And I don’t want the dessert to go waste. 

So Reddit AITA for not making gluten free desserts all the time?

Edit: I changed the wording to reflect that she isn’t diagnosed with celiac

AITA for leaving my friends gf stranded on the road because she never paid? | It was my birthday and I decided to go out for dinner with friends, I invite 4 of them who all bring their gf’s who I know well and like then there is my fifth friend who seems to have a different date every time we meet up and he asks if he can bring his new gf. I don’t want to be a dickhead so I say yes but I say she has to pick her own tab since I don’t know her and we are going to an expensive restaurant. The 12 of us show up and are seated and the night goes great until the bill arrives.

I pay it and we then leave I then go over to her and ask for my 80 dollars (she ordered a 45 dollar steaks and a starter and dessert) she looks at me like I’ve just stepped off mars and then just laughs. I see nothing funny about it and ask again, my friend now comes up to me and asks wtf why are you asking my gf for 80 dollars and I remind him that I said she would have to pay for herself. He says he thought I was joking and now the girl is saying she won’t pay it.  I’m now annoyed and say either you pay me or we’re not giving you a ride home (all my friends side with me). She stands there with her arms crossed so I get in the car and we all drive off. When we get home my gf thought I was an arsehole but I think I was justified I even told her that she had to pay. AITA?


Edit: I’ve come to realise that I should have asked my friend for the money since he was the one I told that she would she to pay or even better not exclude her and just pay the 80 bucks. Ty for all your responses though.


Update: Well it turns out my friend let’s call him Mark “split up” with his gf after that (even though he had like met her twice) and now my gf’s bday is in 2 weeks and Mark asks if he can bring a new girl (he has them lined up or something) and my gf responds with if she can last that long with you, you can come, if not don’t bother coming urself. It turns out my gf doesn’t like Mark at all and wants to cut him out which is actually fine by me.

WIBTA for not hiring someone based on the fact that they were awful to me in high school | I recently got promoted and am in charge of hiring a whole new team. I’ve been doing interviews all week and I have a woman coming in tomorrow who I just realized was my high school ‘bully’ for lack of a better term. She has a different last name now so when I called her for an interview I didn’t realize who she was, and I only used my first name when I called her to set it up. I have been looking potential candidates up on LinkedIn and Facebook and when I found her profile I instantly recognized her. 

I was a year older than all the people in my grade because I started kindergarten late, not because I got held back or anything, but this girl told everyone it was because I was stupid and couldn’t pass my classes. She would also make fun of my hair and clothes and say I was going to die a virgin and stuff like that, and that my only friends were the anime characters I would draw (ok I did have a little bit of an anime phase but I didn’t like go over the top and do the Naruto run or anything and I got over it pretty quick, I just appreciated the artwork and still do). She also interrupted me while I was asking a girl to the prom and told her she could do better. Just dumb shit like that. 

It didn’t scar me for life or anything but she definitely made me feel like shit about myself a lot of the time and luckily I pretty much forgot about her once we all graduated and went off to college. I know she might have changed but I just don’t see myself working with and managing someone who was so rude to me all the time. 

And as tempting as it would be to have her come in and lord it over her during the interview that I’m not gonna hire her, I won’t do that because that’s petty and unprofessional. Really I just want to call her and tell her the position is filled so not to come in for an interview. But now I’m wondering if that would be shitty of me, maybe she has in fact changed and needs this job to support her family or something. What do you guys think?

WIBTA for saying I don’t appreciate my family bringing up one of my biggest mistakes like a joke | So recently my family went on a trip to Georgia to visit my sister and some of her friends. Well we decided to stay at a rather upscale hotel, kind of out of price range given we’re a generic middle class family but that’s not the point. During dinner that night my sister began to talk about pets we used to have when we were younger. She started talking about Guinea Pigs she used to own and the topic of her first one (she had 3) came up.

At little backstory, I have high functioning autism (HFA) which causes me to essentially view things a bit differently than others. When I was about 11 and my sister was 9 she had a Guinea Pig named Candy. She loved Candy and would always play with her. One day when I was home alone I let Candy out in the front yard so she can eat some grass, my sister normally does this with her as well. I went back inside leaving her outside to grab some water. I heard screaming and came out to see Candy in the mouth of our neighbors dog. Candy was dead and when I had to explain that to my Mom and Sister they cried for the next 2 days. They called me horrible names and didn’t want to interact with me for the next week. I never heard wether I was forgiven or not so that horrid memory stays with me to this day, it especially comes back when I’m at my lowest points in time.

Now back to that day, when her friend asked about Candy she said I had killed her to which my mom followed up with she’ll never forgive me for that. We were in public so I didn’t want to make a scene but I felt like someone had just shot me in the heart. It hurt and it took everything I had to not get up and go back to the room. My father thankfully noticed my reaction and changed the subject quickly but it still doesn’t change this distraught feeling I have. 

It’s been a few days now and it’s still in the back of my mind. My question reddit is WIBTA if I confronted them about how hurt I was by their comments?


Update: So I just want to say thanks for all the comments and I did read through all them. I just got done talking with my mom and sister. They said they weren’t aware that it still affected me to this day and they apologized. The three of us had a heart to heart moment about Candy and we came to the conclusion that all is forgiven. Again I want to stress my thanks considering I don’t know if I could’ve spoken about it without the support y’all showed!

WIBTA if I continue to date someone even after I found out how she found me? | For the past two weeks I have been dating Alicia. We met when she followed me on instagram. We didn't have any mutuals but I followed her back and we started DMing. She is a beautiful solid 10 and works as a doctor. 

I took her on a date last week and we had a great time and kissed at the end of it. 

Earlier this week I met up with my best friend Harriet who I have known since I was a kid. I told her about my date but when I showed her Alicia's picture she was very angry. 

Harriet is a nurse and the two of them work in the same department at the same hospital. Harriet does not like Alicia. She claims that she is a snob who is constantly rude to her and humiliates her at every opportunity. She told me that Alicia saw her on a video call to me on a lunch break, and after she was done said I was cute and tried to pester her for my details. 

Harriet refused but Alicia didn't give up, even said she would stop tormenting her at work if she convinced me to go out with her. 

At one point I was chatting to Harriet over text and she left her phone for a minute or so. According to Harriet this is when Alicia took her chance. Harriet has my number saved as my full name so that was all Alicia needed to look me up on social media. 

Harriet was annoyed with me but understood that I didn't know and we're OK. I phoned up Alicia later and demanded the truth, and she started crying admitting that she did look on Harriet's phone, but it was only on impulse and she didn't plan to do it. She said how sorry she was and begged me to please not dump her over this. I took some time to think about it but in the end we started talking again and met up yesterday. Alicia said she didn't understand why anyone would want to be friends with Harriet but we had a great time again and she invited me to come back home with her. 

We had a great night and by the morning she asked if I'd like to be ''exclusive'' with her. I said I needed time which upset her. I would like to be but I feel like that would really damage my friendship with Harriet. She was fuming when I told her how Alicia found me and I don't think she'd be happy if she became my girlfriend. 

Alicia is a gorgeous, funny, bubbly and lovely person who I really want to see more of but I have a gut feeling that I am betraying my friendship with Harriet.

**UPDATE**: I'm the asshole no doubt about that. My friendship with Harriet should come first, and as you guys have said it's wrong to date someone who is cruel to your friends. I texted Alicia saying I won't risk my friendship with Harriet by dating her, but she hasn't responded so I will update when she does.

**UPDATE 2**: Sooo, after watching my phone all evening I got a call from Alicia and answered to her screaming down the phone. She called me every swear word under the sun. From her voice she sounded wasted drunk. She called me a ''snake'' and said that Harriet was a ''tramp'' and an ''ugly c*nt'' and told me that I'd never get a girl as good as her again. I let her rant at me for a few more seconds before cutting the call. I called Harriet and warned her that there may be more problems at work because of how angry Alicia was and that she should consider involving HR. Thanks for the guidance guys. It was a blunder to consider involving myself with her further but I see the error of my ways.

Harriet refused but Alicia didn't give up, even said she would stop tormenting her at work if she convinced me to go out with her. 

At one point I was chatting to Harriet over text and she left her phone for a minute or so. According to Harriet this is when Alicia took her chance. Harriet has my number saved as my full name so that was all Alicia needed to look me up on social media. 

Harriet was annoyed with me but understood that I didn't know and we're OK. I phoned up Alicia later and demanded the truth, and she started crying admitting that she did look on Harriet's phone, but it was only on impulse and she didn't plan to do it. She said how sorry she was and begged me to please not dump her over this. I took some time to think about it but in the end we started talking again and met up yesterday. Alicia said she didn't understand why anyone would want to be friends with Harriet but we had a great time again and she invited me to come back home with her. 

We had a great night and by the morning she asked if I'd like to be ''exclusive'' with her. I said I needed time which upset her. I would like to be but I feel like that would really damage my friendship with Harriet. She was fuming when I told her how Alicia found me and I don't think she'd be happy if she became my girlfriend. 

Alicia is a gorgeous, funny, bubbly and lovely person who I really want to see more of but I have a gut feeling that I am betraying my friendship with Harriet.

**UPDATE**: I'm the asshole no doubt about that. My friendship with Harriet should come first, and as you guys have said it's wrong to date someone who is cruel to your friends. I texted Alicia saying I won't risk my friendship with Harriet by dating her, but she hasn't responded so I will update when she does.

**UPDATE 2**: Sooo, after watching my phone all evening I got a call from Alicia and answered to her screaming down the phone. She called me every swear word under the sun. From her voice she sounded wasted drunk. She called me a ''snake'' and said that Harriet was a ''tramp'' and an ''ugly c*nt'' and told me that I'd never get a girl as good as her again. I let her rant at me for a few more seconds before cutting the call. I called Harriet and warned her that there may be more problems at work because of how angry Alicia was and that she should consider involving HR. Thanks for the guidance guys. It was a blunder to consider involving myself with her further but I see the error of my ways.

WIBTA if I continue to date someone even after I found out how she found me? | For the past two weeks I have been dating Alicia. We met when she followed me on instagram. We didn't have any mutuals but I followed her back and we started DMing. She is a beautiful solid 10 and works as a doctor. 

I took her on a date last week and we had a great time and kissed at the end of it. 

Earlier this week I met up with my best friend Harriet who I have known since I was a kid. I told her about my date but when I showed her Alicia's picture she was very angry. 

Harriet is a nurse and the two of them work in the same department at the same hospital. Harriet does not like Alicia. She claims that she is a snob who is constantly rude to her and humiliates her at every opportunity. She told me that Alicia saw her on a video call to me on a lunch break, and after she was done said I was cute and tried to pester her for my details.

AITA for getting upset at a janitor who whistled at me and my friend to get out of his way? | My friend and I were standing in the lobby at school and this janitor was cleaning the floor.

WIBTA if I left the house while my brother's ex fiance came over for dinner with my family? | My brother**(34M)** & a girl**(34F)** he went to high school with had a long relationship lasting between the ages of 15 - 21 y/o. My brother's girlfriend (lets call her Tina) & our mom became very close because Tina and my mother both came from pretty shitty families growing up. Over the years Tina was great to me**(23M)** & always treated me well, & since I was 10 years younger (5 - 11 y/o) than them, she would take me to do fun things, buy me gifts on occasion etc.

When my brother and Tina were 21 & I was 10. My brother proposed, they got engaged, & eventually about 9 months later, they broke up. My brother was a wreck for a long time. Tina later got engaged to an Australian (lets call him Dick) & moved to live in Australia where they recently married & had kids. However, **Tina and Dick first met at a music festival that was held during the time that my brother and Tina were still engaged.**

After the break up, Tina & my mom still spoke often. My brother is aware, & doesn't like it, but also (AFAIK) hasn't fought to stop it. My brother's wife, who just had their first baby is totally unaware of the relationship that Tina & my mother have.

My mom & Tina Skype every other weekend, my mom buys her babies gifts, & spent over $2000 less than a year ago to fly to Australia to see them as newborns. (We are very far west, and very far north from Australia, **eh.**)

This week-long trip was disclosed to my brother after the flight had already been booked. He didn't stop it but he was very upset & said that my mom could never let his wife know about this. Our entire family now knows about this trip except for my brother's wife who is one of the sweetest people you could ever meet. Every time I have seen them since I have felt uncomfortable knowing how betrayed she would feel that my entire immediate family are all hiding this from her.

**Today,** Tina is coming over with Dick & their 2 babies for dinner. Tina came back to our hometown a few days ago to visit a sick loved one before he passes. I feel wrong sitting with these people in the home my brother & I grew up in.

My mom argues she is basically family & that me not supporting that relationship is wrong because she was so nice to me growing up. (12+ years ago..)

I have a lot of respect for my brother because he takes on challenges quietly & without complaining, but he tends to be someone who can easily be walked all over. I firmly believe that my brother & his family are being disrespected every day that this relationship between Tina & my mom continues, but I am also being told that I'm wrong.

My mom has told me that leaving the house & eating alone tonight would be completely unacceptable, & that I need to stay & catch up with this nice young couple who may have very well caused my brother a lot of pain as a young man.

Would I be the asshole for leaving the house & spending my night alone, even after being told that I ""can't""?

AITA for telling my husband someone else can do his job? | my husband was recently hired on for a job doing, let’s say, accounts receivable for a small company.

only, during his first week, leadership told him he needed to do (let’s say) sales for the first couple of months in order to “earn his keep”.  this was not communicated to him before he took the job.  he has zero sales experience but tried his best while simultaneously looking for a new job because he was uncomfortable with the overall weirdness of the situation.  he also complained of the working environment generally including a lot of yelling by leadership when they were around, but they were generally absent.

he thinks he did well for a beginner in sales, but that he did have questions as this was new to him and no training period was provided.  he came home every day, stressed and depressed.  it really took a toll on him.  three weeks in, he was fired for not cc’ing a leadership member on an e-mail to another member of leadership.  i’ve read the emails and know this to be true.  i’ve also seen communications and can confirm leadership was genuinely unreasonable.

he told me he was almost glad to be fired because the work was so stressful and he doesn’t think anyone could’ve walked into the situation as they laid it out and been successful.  i told him that, actually, statistically speaking, someone would’ve been able to be successful in that job.  he told me that when i said that, it felt like i was calling him a failure.  i told him that i wasn’t saying he was a failure, but that i like to be honest with people and not comfort them with lies.  the truth is, someone out there could’ve done this job.  

now he’s calling me an asshole.  so, aita?

only, during his first week, leadership told him he needed to do (let’s say) sales for the first couple of months in order to “earn his keep”.  this was not communicated to him before he took the job.  he has zero sales experience but tried his best while simultaneously looking for a new job because he was uncomfortable with the overall weirdness of the situation.  he also complained of the working environment generally including a lot of yelling by leadership when they were around, but they were generally absent.

he thinks he did well for a beginner in sales, but that he did have questions as this was new to him and no training period was provided.  he came home every day, stressed and depressed.  it really took a toll on him.  three weeks in, he was fired for not cc’ing a leadership member on an e-mail to another member of leadership.  i’ve read the emails and know this to be true.  i’ve also seen communications and can confirm leadership was genuinely unreasonable.

he told me he was almost glad to be fired because the work was so stressful and he doesn’t think anyone could’ve walked into the situation as they laid it out and been successful.  i told him that, actually, statistically speaking, someone would’ve been able to be successful in that job.  he told me that when i said that, it felt like i was calling him a failure.  i told him that i wasn’t saying he was a failure, but that i like to be honest with people and not comfort them with lies.  the truth is, someone out there could’ve done this job.  

now he’s calling me an asshole.  so, aita?

WIBTA if I told my best friend what she’s doing is fucked up... | Sorry this is going to be a long one. 

My best friend and roommate (we’ll call her A) was dating a guy (we’ll call him B) for around eight months. My roommates and I loved B. He was and still is one of our best friends. However, she broke up with him earlier this year after hanging out with her ex-boyfriend, feeling stressed over the distance (like an hour apart from one another, nothing extreme), and said she just wanted to be single. 

Immediately after A and B broke up, A started seeing another boy (we’ll call him C). C was at our house every day over this summer. Essentially he was our 5th roommate. We mentioned to her that it was a little suspect that she instantly starting spending every waking moment (literally) with C after breaking up with B (who she said she was going to marry) in order to be single. 

Fast forward to a music festival this summer. B and his sister camped with our group. A and B acted like they were dating the entire time. Holding hands, skipping and shit, the whole nine yards. Let it be known that C was also at this music festival. A would go off and spend time with C as well. I’m not sure if they also held hands and skipped but I don’t doubt it because keep in mind, C has been living with us for over a month now. 

A couple weeks ago, A told me she wanted to end things with C in order to get back together with B. I advised her to think carefully about what she was going to do because it isn’t fair to B and C for her to flip flop. She ended things with C, but wanted to maintain a friendship since they work together. 

B comes and stays the weekend with us last week. Things are great. They’re acting like a couple and what not, good shit. We even went to B’s huge ass family gathering. They also booked a trip to Europe together (leaving in a couple months.) So to everyone else except for A apparently, it seems like they’re dating. 

This week, however, A has been going to C’s house. She has spent the past two or three nights at his house, went to a show with him last night, and has continued to talk to him (very frequently) all of which she has kept from B. 

Last night, I text A to see if she wanted to grab a beer, and she said she was out with C. I just asked if B was like... okay with that? To which she responded that “B and I aren’t dating. I didn’t tell him, but it isn’t his business. Nothing is happening lmao.” 

This entire situation makes me uncomfortable. I’ve been good about minding my own business, but it’s at the point where she can’t keep both of them at arm’s reach with no repercussions. I’ve been with her through this whole thing, listening to her vent and cry, trying to give good advice, just being a friend. However, B is one of my best friends, and C and I became close friends as well, so there’s multiple people I care about being fucked over here. 

So, Reddit, would I be the asshole if I told my best friend that what she’s doing is fucked up?

AITA for ""not being sensitive"" to my friend's addiction? | EDIT- There are some solid points here. I accept my judgment and will call her to apologize. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My friend Liz (20F) is living in New Mexico for the summer. While there, her ID expired. She used to smoke cigarettes but has moved on to juul. I (22M) absolutely despise cigarettes, and tolerate juul/other vapes at best. She knows this about me. 

Here is a verbatim conversation we had, formatted a little better to read here. Most sentences are split to unique texts.

Liz: NM fucking sucks. They have this fucking law that I can't use my old ID for anything and I understand it. But I can't get juul pods. I mean, I understand it. But like I'm just not supposed to do anything? wtf. IT SUCKS

Me: That's all states. Can't use expired ID. Can't say I have any sympathy about being denied nicotine *shrug emoji*

Liz: Shut up.

I don't respond.

Liz: Okay. You know we all have vices. Sometimes we drink too much, or eat too much. I'm not proud of the juul but I'm not smoking cigs anymore. I don't need you to tell me it's bad because I know already. That was a dick move and doesn't sit right with me.

Me: Those other vices also don't hurt surrounding people or the planet. IDK what you expected from me. I'm pretty vocal about my hatred of that stuff.

Liz: I don't need to hear it from you. I know you don't support my choices but that doesn't make it okay. I don't need a lecture. I need to quit on my own time and I'm not ready to.

I don't respond.

Next day she wants to talk about it, I'm not really too interested in talking about it and fine to disagree. We talk anyway, basically her argument is that I hurt her feelings. I think she just feels bad about her own poor choices and wants me to coddle her while she makes them, which I won't. I can't be responsible for her own feelings, and I definitely do not feel bad about her not being able to continue giving herself cancer. Apparently to her I was being an asshole.

So, was I?

Next day she wants to talk about it, I'm not really too interested in talking about it and fine to disagree. We talk anyway, basically her argument is that I hurt her feelings. I think she just feels bad about her own poor choices and wants me to coddle her while she makes them, which I won't. I can't be responsible for her own feelings, and I definitely do not feel bad about her not being able to continue giving herself cancer. Apparently to her I was being an asshole.

AITA for ""not being sensitive"" to my friend's addiction? | EDIT- There are some solid points here. I accept my judgment and will call her to apologize. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My friend Liz (20F) is living in New Mexico for the summer. While there, her ID expired. She used to smoke cigarettes but has moved on to juul. I (22M) absolutely despise cigarettes, and tolerate juul/other vapes at best. She knows this about me. 

Here is a verbatim conversation we had, formatted a little better to read here. Most sentences are split to unique texts.

Liz: NM fucking sucks. They have this fucking law that I can't use my old ID for anything and I understand it. But I can't get juul pods. I mean, I understand it. But like I'm just not supposed to do anything? wtf. IT SUCKS

Me: That's all states. Can't use expired ID. Can't say I have any sympathy about being denied nicotine *shrug emoji*

Liz: Shut up.

I don't respond.

Liz: Okay. You know we all have vices. Sometimes we drink too much, or eat too much. I'm not proud of the juul but I'm not smoking cigs anymore. I don't need you to tell me it's bad because I know already. That was a dick move and doesn't sit right with me.

Me: Those other vices also don't hurt surrounding people or the planet. IDK what you expected from me. I'm pretty vocal about my hatred of that stuff.

Liz: I don't need to hear it from you. I know you don't support my choices but that doesn't make it okay. I don't need a lecture. I need to quit on my own time and I'm not ready to.

AITA for not wanting my bf to go with his friends? | I thought I was a complete asshole in this situation, but I saw a similar post a couple of days ago, which included a similar situation, but the focus was on a different point, but the comments briefly mentioned the situation I am in, so I am now confused and don't know what to do.

Essentially, me and my bf said that we were going to go to an escape room when they first started to become popular. Life got ahead of us, and being long distance meant that we never got a chance to. He and his family ended up going to one for one of their birthdays, and whilst I was slightly upset about not being able to experience it together for the first time for us both, it was no big deal, as it wasn't the one that we had shown an interest in together. A year or so has passed, and we still haven't got round to going together. He then mentioned to me that his friend is planning on going to the exact one we planned to go to for his birthday, and my boyfriend said he didn't really want to go, but probably will. I had a bit of a moan at him about me always missing out on things, to which he called me unreasonable, so I dropped it. I don't very often complain at him for doing things without me, but he does quite often go places we planned to try out together, and then brushes it off when I am upset about it. I don't care that he does things which we have already done, or that he sees his friends or whatever, just that he can't seem to wait for me to try new things. I know the escape room situation is different, as he didn't get to choose what it is, but not only can he not really afford it, but he doesn't really even want to go with his friends. So, am I being unreasonable by not wanting him to go with his friends? I just feel it would waste a plan which we want to do together, for the sake of not disappointing his friend who he does everything with all the time.

AITA for wanting to move somewhere I can’t afford but my bf can? | Throwaway in case anyone recognizes our situation. 

My boyfriend and I of 3 years are finally moving in together. We live in a really, really expensive city where rent can be exorbitant. I currently live in a smaller flat with 3 roommates and my bf lives close to the city center in a small flat he bought 2 years ago. 

We’ve decided that we’ll look for a new, larger place that’s just “ours” and my bf will sell his flat or rent it out (he hasn’t decided yet.) 

So right now we’re looking around but we can’t decide on a budget. For one, he earns 7x what I do (45k vs. ~300k) and can afford so much more in rent. I want to look at larger places that are far out of my price range ($800-1000) but he could easily afford ($4000-5000) because these are the only ones that are close to both of our work and large enough to live in comfortably with two people. However, he wants to look at cheaper flats that A) are affordable to me and B) would allow him to pay roughly the same as me. 

We had a fight recently where I said I’d like to look at more expensive flats and he asked me how I’d afford my share (he thinks I should pay 35-40% of rent). I said I’d like to pay what I’m paying now ($750) and he could make up the rest. He got upset at me even though it would still be a smaller share of his income. I feel guilty to asking him to pay more but I feel upset that he’d rather live in a smaller, shittier flat just so I “pay my equal share” than spend more so we could both be comfortable. AITA for the suggestion?

**edit:** sorry I got the math wrong, he wants me to contribute 35-40% not 25-30%. So our budget would be $2200 a month if I contribute the same as before ($750). This cost is essentially nothing to him though but I feel like he’s sticking to it for the principle which makes me feel really shitty.

AITA for suggesting that my nephew's bad behaviour is mostly due to parenting to my Brother? | My Nephew has always been a bit of a problem child. He has been Smoking since he was 9 years old, has been expelled from 3 schools. He pretty much stays home and plays on his phone all day and doesn't go to school anymore. He has also had several run ins with the law enforcement for underage driving, drinking, unruly behaviour and so on. He's sixteen years old now and his only friends are other 30 year olds sitting at home and wasting their lives. 

Me and my family recently shifted to our native country, where my nephew lives. His parents, i.e my brother and his wife cannot combat his behaviour at all. My brother left him in my place so that he has no access from his devices and his friends (who are most likely drug users). 

It was incredibly difficult to live with this child the first few days. He's obnoxious, rude and destructive. I put some rules into place, like do your chores(doing his dishes, making bed and doing laundry once a week). The same rules everyone in the family follows. He didn't like it at all. He bullied my kid, tried to burn a blanket, stole my car keys, broke some stuff. He did all this expecting that I'd kick him out. But I didn't. Whenever he broke a rule, we would remove all forms of entertainment and he would get bored and eventually he would do as told. We'd sit him down and explain that actions have consequences. He also earned an allowance by helping me clear the attic(old house) and do some repair work, and compensation would be taken out of that if he broke something. We also prohibited smoking, instead I gave him nicotine gum at regular intervals to prevent withdrawal.

While he was extremely resistant for a while, he eventually gave in and started doing things without being told. He stayed with us for 3 months and there has been a massive change in his attitude. While he is still very rude and obnoxious, he stopped smoking, is not destructive, does his chores and has expressed an interest in going back to school. He also opened up that his Father was always busy, and didn't care if he lived or was dead. He told me that his mother would cart him around therapist to therapist, and whenever they would express that he has a particular disorder she would change doctors. From what I learned, my brother is a workaholic and his mother is heavily into alternative treatments, MLM's, and other things so she's away from home a lot.

When I took him back, I sat them both down and told them that I felt that they both should stay home more and look after their kid. He was very starved for attention and love, and he needed them both. They were extremely offended, and basically banned the kid from talking to me. It's been a few weeks and I have tried to contact him several times but I can't reach him. 

So was I the AH from suggesting that their parenting was to blame, not the kid? I'm worried sick about the kid, he would most definitely break if he sees a cigarette again.

AITA for suggesting that my nephew's bad behaviour is mostly due to parenting to my Brother? | My Nephew has always been a bit of a problem child. He has been Smoking since he was 9 years old, has been expelled from 3 schools. He pretty much stays home and plays on his phone all day and doesn't go to school anymore. He has also had several run ins with the law enforcement for underage driving, drinking, unruly behaviour and so on. He's sixteen years old now and his only friends are other 30 year olds sitting at home and wasting their lives. 

Me and my family recently shifted to our native country, where my nephew lives. His parents, i.e my brother and his wife cannot combat his behaviour at all. My brother left him in my place so that he has no access from his devices and his friends (who are most likely drug users). 

It was incredibly difficult to live with this child the first few days. He's obnoxious, rude and destructive. I put some rules into place, like do your chores(doing his dishes, making bed and doing laundry once a week). The same rules everyone in the family follows. He didn't like it at all. He bullied my kid, tried to burn a blanket, stole my car keys, broke some stuff. He did all this expecting that I'd kick him out. But I didn't. Whenever he broke a rule, we would remove all forms of entertainment and he would get bored and eventually he would do as told. We'd sit him down and explain that actions have consequences. He also earned an allowance by helping me clear the attic(old house) and do some repair work, and compensation would be taken out of that if he broke something. We also prohibited smoking, instead I gave him nicotine gum at regular intervals to prevent withdrawal.

While he was extremely resistant for a while, he eventually gave in and started doing things without being told. He stayed with us for 3 months and there has been a massive change in his attitude.

AITA for specifying what kind of gifts people should give my son for his birthday? | My toddler has sensory issues and doesn’t enjoy toys that light up/move/make noise/etc., he looks at them and then either cries or becomes overwhelmed and won’t play with them so they end up being donated/trashed.

His birthday is in March and I’ve been compiling a thoughtful Amazon wishlist of toys and activities I think he would enjoy since November. Most of these toys are wooden and a bit pricier because they’re higher quality than the plastic stuff but there is only one item on there that is over $50, most items are $10-$25 and our families are very well off. I sent the wishlist out to our families for Christmas ideas and they didn’t buy anything on there. Not a big deal, I was clear that these were just suggestions but stressed that we really did not want/would not use electronic toys. However, all my son got for Christmas were electronic toys; some of which were quite pricey and all of them made him cry. Most of these toys are still in the original package sitting in a closet upstairs or were donated in the original packaging. 

Now that his birthday is coming up, I’ve been making the same requests but on his birthday invitations I wrote “If you’d like to give ‘NAME’ a gift, we respectfully ask for nothing battery operated or electronic, thank you!” and once again directed them to his “wishlist”. 

I’ve been fielding phone calls and passive aggressive texts/comments about how he should just be grateful he’s being given anything at all, “beggars shouldn’t be choosers”, and since it’s their gift, they should be able to decide what to give him. 

On the one hand, I see their point and I am grateful that he has people in his life who want to buy him gifts but on the other hand, it’s upsetting for my son to have a pile of toys that make him cry.

AITA for asking my girlfriend to show a prospective buyer my couch when I wasn't home? | I’ve been trying to sell my old couch for the past 2 weeks. It’s in good condition but my girlfriend hates it and so I posted an ad for it on kijiji. Someone contacted me that they were interested in buying it and wanted to come over to see it. I work 9-6 Monday to Friday but he only worked evenings so our schedules didn’t mesh. However, he wanted to see it ASAP. My girlfriend does not work on Wednesday's and usually spends it studying at home for an exam she’s taking soon so I figured that she could show the guy the couch and if he wanted to buy it take the money for it.

&#x200B;

When I told my girlfriend - she was angry and said that I should have asked her first (I admit I should have but I knew she was going to be home anyway- she’s a homebody). She said she refused to be home alone with some random guy I found on the internet and that anything could happen. I thought she was being a bit ridiculous. For example, she was home alone one time when someone came to fix our internet . She insisted that was different since it was through our landlord and it was an official business but this is some random guy she doesn’t know and that “strange men” make her nervous. I still thought she was being silly but she flat out refused and thought I was being insensitive. I had to contact the guy and say the day didn’t work anymore. He got annoyed and kind of lost interest in the couch after that - much to my disappointment and now I'm still trying to sell the couch.

&#x200B;

I just don’t understand why she was being difficult but she insists she did nothing wrong and was just looking out for her safety.

AITA here?

We have really all we need and are content with our lives as is. My mother has been bouncing around states for a while now. She left, moved away whatever when I was 17 to go live with her boyfriend. At that time I fend for my self, slept at peoples houses and then decided to move to Florida for a better live. Fast forward to now nearly 10years later, where I found a wonderful man who takes care of our family. She throws it in my face as if I don’t deserve to be happy . She makes me feel guilty because I won’t let her live in our home. We like to like a certain way and like our things done our way. We did try to have her stay, she’s wonderful with the kids and they love her dearly. It got to the point where my husband said it’s either me or her ?!  She’s just old school stuck in her ways: AITA for saying no? She is living with my sister now and says she’s rather be with me. She can’t get her own place because she’s basically poor, doesn’t work, doesn’t want to work. I have a hard time saying no to her, she’s my mom and I love her. However, I don’t want to break my happy home. Help, she’s needs to find her path in life , sorry it doesn’t involve living with us . Rant over. No Assholes here.

AITA for not wanting my wife to give expensive gifts to my son | Not wanting my wife to give expensive gifts to my son

I have a son with my ex wife. We got divorced when he was around the age of 11 ( he is now 16 ). I cheated with another women and she didn’t really managed to “fulfill” me. We aren’t exactly friends but we don’t hate each other. In the other hand, my relationship with my son has worsen since our divorced. He is very distant to me, he seems more close to his mom boyfriend than to me. And it got to the point in which I kinda gave up. I had him each other weekend, at first we went out to see movies or to visit his grandparents. But recently I have seen how he doesn’t seem to care. He doesn’t really want to visit me and there had been a couple of weekends in which he simply decided to not visit me.

So, basically a couple of weeks before Christmas I was planning with his mother what we would do in Christmas and new year. We decided thta j was going to get him in New year and her in Christmas. Out of curiosity I asked her what she was going to gift our son. Apparently because he has been a very good student this last years she decided to buy him a new and better PC ( my son loves videogames and apparently he complained about his computer not being good enough for playing those games ). And this PC wasn’t cheap. I don’t remember how much did it cost but it was considerably expensive. I told her that it was too much money for a gift to a kid. And this started an argument. Like I said, she makes more money than me and thus her gifts are more expensive than mines ( for example a couple of years she bought him a ps4 ). 

My problems with this are two. 1: I don’t want my kid to be a spoiled kid, sure he has been good at school but he hasn’t really worked for it, not even in a symbolic way. I’m afraid that he will believe that his mother will buy him all he wants without working. 2: This is also something bad for my relationship with my kid. Like I said, I don’t have a good relationship with him but I’m trying to fix it. And her giving him these kind of gifts will only reinforce the idea of her being a better parent than me.

Unfortunately, she gift it anyways and the relationship with my son is still bad. I’m very angry at her about this, but maybe I’m wrong? I have been trying to think about recently and I have still not got to a conclusion.

AITA for not wanting to forgive my brother for years of mistreatment? | I (18f) have an older brother (23m) and our relationship is extremely rocky. He dropped out after about a year and a half of JuCo and didn’t tell anyone. Which, while I don’t judge him for dropping out, I have a big issue with him keeping it from everyone.

l have an issue because while he was dropped out and lying, both my parents had surgery. (Summer of 2019). So, most of the housework fell on me. The biggest one was taking care of my other brother (20m) who has autism. All while I was starting my first semester at college (thankfully I still live at home while at uni). It was a tough time. Since my brother was lying about school, he would leave the house early in the morning (6am) and wouldn’t be back till late (9-10pm, when my brother and parents are already asleep).

I was already frustrated with doing everything on my own, but at that point, I didn’t know he was lying. I was more upset that he wasn’t appreciative of me at all, and seemingly didn’t give a shit about my parents, especially my mom, who went through a very invasive and painful surgery. He also was always around the house with an extremely bad attitude, snapping at me, barely even speaking to me and basically treating me like a nuisance, like he was a teenager again.

This treatment and pushing of responsibilities onto me is nothing new. Growing up, when my parents left for a weekend, he would “watch” my brother and I, but he would completely ignore us or talk to us as if we were the most annoying people on the planet. Didn’t do wonders for my self esteem and, once again, I took care of my other brother on my own. The treatment never left.

After he finally came clean about dropping out, he also said he was struggling with depression and didn’t want to tell anyone, because “nobody would understand”. I was upset by this, since both my parents have PTSD, and my mother and I struggle with anxiety and depression. Our family has been through a lot and we’re very open. While I don’t fault him for being scared to talk about these things, I get upset when he acts as though he is the only one struggling, and thus has an excuse to be rude and mean to us. Like he’s using his depression as an excuse to not help around the house and just be a mean person to us.

Recently, he did something stupid and almost lost his girlfriend. I’m not sure, but I guess it flipped a switch in him and he’s been acting way nicer and doing nice things. He actually talks to my brother and I like people and is being honest.

I feel like it’s too late for us. I’ve never felt like he’s loved me as a sister and never treated me with respect. I don’t feel like I need to forgive him. But then I feel guilty because I’m sure his therapist is why he’s turning over a new leaf like this. I feel like if I don't open up, I’ll be stifling his growth. But it’s hard after years of mistreatment.

TL;DR: AITA if i don’t give my brother a chance to right his wrongs with me?

AITA for telling my boss not to hire my friend? | So I just started working again at my old job (after a break while I was in classes), at a school. My friend wants to work there too and knows my boss really likes me so he values my recommendations. She applied, and wants me to put in a good word. 

However, I specifically pulled my boss aside today and told him not to hire her. 

My friend and I lived together for almost three years, and I saw her work etiquette through those years (she worked at a drugstore). She was late by at least fifteen minutes each shift, and sometimes wouldn’t even show up. She’s been fired from multiple jobs for this behavior. 

Attendance is so important at the school because subs are so hard to find. I tried to avoid giving my boss details, but basically told him that she wouldn’t be a good fit. I don’t want to be held responsible when she inevitably blows the job off, because I’d been the one to refer her. Does that make sense?

AITA for wanting to spend the later part of the night at the hospital with my girlfriend instead of celebrating my father's birthday? | So a little bit of background. After me (17) and my girlfriend (16) spent the entire day with her family, we got a call that her grandma's boyfriend of 8+ years (so basically her grandpa) was admitted into the hospital and likely won't make it. During this same time, my family was celebrating my dad's birthday, which isn't actually for another 2 days, and is only one out of several parties that we have planned. I explained to my mom that I needed to go to the hospital rather than go to my dad's birthday party. Granted I didn't know her 'grandpa', as we have been dating for a relatively short amount of time, but she certainly did and I felt the need to be there for her and to support her. After being there for about an hour and a half (the time now being 11:15) my mom told me I needed to come home right away to spend time with my dad, and it was non-negotiable. Am I in the wrong for being upset that I couldn't stay and comfort my girlfriend?

AITA for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising? | So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she’s heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I’m hungry. 

I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I’ve never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it’s like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter “where’s the rest of my steak?” and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don’t care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it’s absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it’s highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

I’m complaining to my girlfriend and she’s getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I’m a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. 

When the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that’s where we’re different, I don’t let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

A manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don’t end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald’s and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It’s now the next day and I’m starting to think I didn’t handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). My girlfriend hasn’t responded to my texts so now I’m starting to think I’m an asshole.

AITA for not giving my college roommate free rides back home because of a lease ""benefit"" I received? | At the beginning of the year, we both signed a lease to get a nice apartment right off-campus.  When we went in to sign the lease, they had a deal going on in which we were able to choose between 50% off a parking spot or a free Nintendo Switch. Since my roommate and I do not have time for video games, he told me he was cool with me getting the 50% off parking since I am the only one that owns a car. I have a car on campus as it is helpful for getting groceries and I like to go back home at least once a month. 

I usually give him rides back home as our hometowns are very near each other and we typically split the gas. I usually charge him around $30 for a round trip back home that is three hours away. I never charge him for gas when we go grocery shopping or cruise around town.  Out of nowhere, he has been subtly bringing up the fact that he deserves at least 3-4 free rides back home because he received ""no benefit"" out of signing the lease. Right off the bat, I said no because I still had to pay for the parking spot and there are much more expenses that go into my car other than just the gas. I truly believe he is getting a benefit out of this as he is paying much less for a round trip to home compared to taking the bus or the train. He keeps bringing up the fact that he got ""no benefit"" out of the deal at least once a week since we started school this semester and he has been making me feel as if I am in the wrong for this. He has now even said that I owe *him* half of what I paid for the parking spot. My philosophy is that if he truly had an issue with this he should have brought it up at the time we signed the apartment lease. AITA for not giving in and giving him free rides back home?
